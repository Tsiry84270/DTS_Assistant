Therefore, with the guest experience in mind, there are four \nmain goals the design team must address from the onset of the project:\n1. Design guest rooms that are aesthetically pleasing while providing privacy, safety and a \ncalming environment, which encourages guests to feel relaxed and comfortable so that \nthey enjoy their stay and are more apt to return.\n2. Design multi-purpose meeting spaces with acoustical environment and speech \nintelligibility levels appropriate for meetings and receptions, both large and small, where \na variety of communication styles can be effectively used and the sense of intimacy \nbetween presenter and audience can be experienced.\n3. Design food and beverage spaces that create a comfortable and safe environment for \ndiners and employees, free of distractions from kitchen noise, outdoor noise and noise \nfrom nearby conversations.\n4. Design a soothing, peaceful and calm environment for a true spa experience, without \ndistracting noise from adjacent spaces, from one treatment room to another and from \nexternal noise sources (such as street traffic).\nIn order to achieve these goals, there are several noise/vibration control and acoustics-related \nissues that must be addressed, regardless of the size of the property being designed.\nThese include, but are not limited to:\n \n\u2014 Noise transmission between guest rooms\n \n\u2014 Poor speech intelligibility in meeting spaces\n \n\u2014 Mechanical noise from HVAC elements\n \n\u2014 Elevator vibration in guest room and meeting spaces\n \n\u2014 Plumbing noise\n \n\u2014 External noise from adjacent roads and/or airport, etc.\nWhile the perceived unwanted sound and vibration varies, these are typically a result of \nairborne or structure-borne transmission. Regardless of the source of noise/vibration and \nthe transmission method, three main approaches (listed in order of cost-effectiveness) are \ncommonly used to mitigate noise and vibration:\n1. Control at the noise source location, \n2. Modify the transmission path, \n3. Control at the listener. \nAcoustics | Technical Document\nGeneral Requirements  |  Acoustics Design Criteria  |  1.

When \nthat is not feasible, the project acoustical consultant should be involved in the process to \nrecommend possible noise/vibration control strategies and related costs and benefits.\nCurtain Wall\nThe project acoustical consultant shall conduct a study to determine the expected noise \nlevels at the project site and offer noise mitigating strategies that will  \nkeep noise levels within the limits defined herein while keeping the project  \ncosts within budget.\nBuilding orientation in relation to the noise source(s), noise barriers, etc., should be \nconsidered before relying entirely on the curtain wall to block all unwanted sounds.\nOnce the degree of isolation is established, curtain walls shall be designed based on OITC \n(Outdoor-Indoor Transmission Class) performance instead of STC (Sound Transmission \nClass). OITC is a better acoustical indicator for this purpose since it is determined based on \na spectrum shape that is an average of three typical spectra from transportation sources \n(aircraft take off, freeway, and railroad pass by), while STC is only accurate for speech sounds \nand not recommended for amplified music, mechanical equipment noise, transportation noise \nor any sound with substantial low- frequency energy below 125 Hz.\nInterior Walls\nIn order to provide the required sound transmission loss between adjacent noise sensitive \nspaces and/or between quiet and noisy areas, the following guidelines shall be observed:\n \n\u2014 Run all gypsum board layers vertically, with no joints except at the studs.\n \n\u2014 Stagger joints of gypsum board layers a minimum of 305mm (12 inches) apart where \nmultiple layers occur; tape outer joints only.\n \n\u2014 Caulk all partition types as per details provided in this section.\nAcoustics | Technical Document\nGeneral Requirements  |  Acoustics Design Criteria  |  1.

This can be very disruptive when guests \nare trying to rest, have productive meetings, and collaborate with remote individuals through \nvideo conferencing.\nWhile acoustical considerations must be made during all phases of the construction process, \ncontrol of the mechanical system noise is most effective if evaluated and addressed during \nthe early design phases. Noise and vibration control strategies implemented as retrofits after \nconstruction are expensive, disruptive and seldom meet expectations.\nThe quality of mechanical equipment and general construction is (typically) never better than \nwhen the building is brand new. As time passes and seals\nand bearings wear, the level of background noise will increase. Thus, compromising design \nstandards during value engineering, cost cutting, or material or method substitution \nprocesses will have a long term impact on the quality of the guest experience and the \nproperty reputation.\nFrom an acoustical standpoint, a typical design sequence should start with the selection of \nquietest equipment that complies with budget and operational requirements, located away \nfrom noise sensitive areas. This needs to be complemented with proper ductwork layout, \nadequate air velocities at terminal devices, and mechanical isolation from the building \nstructure.\nThe acoustical consultant for the project shall perform a numerical analysis (based on \nmanufacturer-provided data for the specified equipment) to confirm that the proposed HVAC \ndesign meets the applicable criteria.\nAcoustics | Technical Document\nGeneral Requirements  |  Acoustics Design Criteria  |  1.

This vibration then radiates as \nairborne noise into the adjacent areas.\nLightweight PVC plastic pipe is now commonly used to replace cast iron, copper or mild \nsteel tubing. Because of its lightweight (i.e. low damping, mid-high radiation efficiency) \nconstruction, PVC pipes are easily set into motion due to fluid flow, with the result being an \nincrease in concerns and complaints directed towards noise.\nPlumbing Noise Control\nThe following are guidelines are intended to reduce plumbing noise:\n \n\u2014  Water velocity should not exceed 2m/s (6ft/s), and pipe sizes should be adjusted for this \nmaximum velocity.\n \n\u2014  Waste and water supply lines should not be installed in any walls enclosing noise sensitive \nspaces.\n \n\u2014  Vertical drain pipes should not be installed within interior or on the exterior walls of noise \nsensitive spaces.\n \n\u2014  The number of pipe transitions (tees, elbows, Y connections, etc.) should be kept to a \nminimum.\n \n\u2014  Regulators should be installed as required to ensure that the water pressure is no \ngreater than 344,000Pa (50pounds per square inch) in the main water supply lines.\n \n\u2014  Water-hammer arresters should be placed close to quick-acting valves and should be \ninstalled at the end of plumbing lines over 10m (35ft) long.\n \n\u2014  Plumbing penetrations on opposite sides of any sound-rated partition assembly should be \nseparated by a minimum distance of 406mm (16in).\n \n\u2014 Select plumbing valves of the ball-type which exhibit minimum noise when in use.\n \n\u2014  Select faucets and taps with fully ported nozzles and equipped with aeration or anti-\nsplash devices.\n \n\u2014  Waste piping and water supply piping should be isolated from the building construction at \npoints of contact with resilient sleeves, vibration isolators, or a minimum of 6.4mm (\u00bc-\ninch) of resilient material such as soft neoprene, rubber, felt padding, etc.\nAcoustical lagging over piping may be necessary when additional attenuation is required over \nnoise sensitive areas.\nAcoustics | Technical Document\nGeneral Requirements  |  Acoustics Design Criteria  |  1.

The relative \nloudness depends on the construction of the transformer, the manner of installation and the \nambient sound level at the site.\nWhen transformers are not properly mounted or supported, their vibration is transmitted \nto the support structure and finds its way in neighbouring spaces, manifesting itself as an \nannoying tonal noise.\nPlanning of transformer placement and proper installation can significantly reduce \ntransformer noise. Therefore, the following guidelines should be observed.\n \n\u2014  Install transformer(s) as far as possible from areas where the sound could  \nbe objectionable.\n \n\u2014  Avoid placing transformer(s) near multiple reflective surfaces such as in a corner, near a \nceiling or floor, or in a hallway.\n \n\u2014  Isolate the transformer core and coils from the ground or supporting structure using \nproper vibration isolators. Air cooled dry transformers require isolating  \nthe core and coil from its support structure. Oil filled transformers require isolating the \ncore and coil from its tank base and isolate its tank base from the support structure.\n \n\u2014  Use flexible conduit couplings between the transformer and the wiring system. This \nincludes incoming cables, bus bars, stand-off insulators, etc., since any  \nrigid connection from the vibrating transformer to a solid structure will  \ntransmit vibration.\n \n\u2014  Mount transformer(s) on an inertia base or on a surface with the largest  \npossible mass.\n \n\u2014  The transformer room dimensions should not correspond to half wavelength of the \ntransformer noise/vibration frequencies.\n \n\u2014  The transformer room walls, ceiling, floor, and access doors shall be designed according \nto airborne transmission guidelines provided herein.

See notes for guest floors.\nCar Parks\nWhen the car park is located underground or on a level different from the \nentrance level, the car park must be served by one or more lifts separate from \nthe bedroom guest lifts, depending on traffic study. \nService Areas\nClean and Dirty elevators must be provided to meet International HACCP \nrequirements. These elevators will be provided for staff movements, linen, \nservice, room-service and luggage service.  Two or more service lifts are \nrequired depending on the traffic study, hotel brand requirements or local \nauthorities (Separate lifts are to be required for segregate \u201cclean\u201d and \u201cdirty\u201d \nuse).\nConference and \nBanqueting areas\nA specific vehicle lift may be required when the conference and banqueting areas \nare not located on street level, to allow access for exhibition setting-up works or \nto display vehicles or large equipment). To avoid the need to provide multiple lifts \nfor different services, a single service lift may usually serve multiple uses. These \ncombinations of use must be considered based on hotel size to ensure that they do \nnot result in a conflict of traffic which could disrupt or delay service.
