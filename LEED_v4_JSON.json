Only use the occupancy estimates if occupancy is \nunknown. \n \nFor the calculation, use gross floor area, not net or leasable floor area.  Gross floor area is defined as the \nsum of all areas on all floors of a building included within the outside faces of the exterior wall, including \ncommon areas, mechanical spaces, circulation areas, and all floor penetrations that connect one floor to \nanother. To determine gross floor area, multiply the building footprint (in square feet or square meters) by \nthe number of floors in the building.

Laboratories that conduct the tests specified in this credit must be accredited \nunder ISO/IEC 17025 for the test methods they use. \n \nEmissions and Content Requirements \nTo demonstrate compliance, a product or layer must meet all of the following requirements, as applicable.  \n \nInherently nonemitting sources. Products that are inherently nonemitting sources of VOCs (stone, \nceramic, powder-coated metals, plated or anodized metal, glass, concrete, clay brick, and unfinished or \nuntreated solid wood) are considered fully compliant without any VOC emissions testing if they do not \ninclude integral organic-based surface coatings, binders, or sealants.  \n \nGeneral emissions evaluation. Building products must be tested and determined compliant in accordance \nwith California Department of Public Health (CDPH) Standard Method v1.1\u20132010, using the applicable \nexposure scenario. The default scenario is the private office scenario. The manufacturer\u2019s or third-party \ncertification must state the exposure scenario used to determine compliance. Claims of compliance for \nwet-applied products must state the amount applied in mass per surface area. \n \nManufacturers\u2019 claims of compliance with the above requirements must also state the range of total VOCs \nafter 14 days (336 hours), measured as specified in the CDPH Standard Method v1.1: \n\u2022 \n0.5 mg/m3 or less; \n\u2022 \nbetween 0.5 and 5.0 mg/m3; or \n\u2022 \n5.0 mg/m3 or more. \n \nProjects outside the U.S. may use products tested and deemed compliant in accordance with either (1) \nthe CDPH standard method (2010) or (2) the German AgBB Testing and Evaluation Scheme (2010).  \nTest products either with (1) the CDPH Standard Method (2010), (2) the German AgBB Testing and \nEvaluation Scheme (2010), (3) ISO 16000-3: 2010, ISO 16000-6: 2011, ISO 16000-9: 2006, ISO 16000-\n11:2006 either in conjunction with AgBB, or with French legislation on VOC emission class labeling, or (4) \nthe DIBt testing method (2010).  If the applied testing method does not specify testing details for a \nproduct group for which the CDPH standard method does provide details, use the specifications in the \nCDPH standard method. U.S. projects must follow the CDPH standard method. \n  \nAdditional VOC content requirements for wet-applied products. In addition to meeting the general \nrequirements for VOC emissions (above), on-site wet-applied products must not contain excessive levels \nof VOCs, for the health of the installers and other tradesworkers who are exposed to these products. To \ndemonstrate compliance, a product or layer must meet the following requirements, as applicable.  \nDisclosure of VOC content must be made by the manufacturer. Any testing must follow the test method \nspecified in the applicable regulation.  \n\u2022 \nAll paints and coatings wet-applied on site must meet the applicable VOC limits of the California \nAir Resources Board (CARB) 2007, Suggested Control Measure (SCM) for Architectural \nCoatings, or the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) Rule 1113, effective \nJune 3, 2011. \n\u2022 \nAll adhesives and sealants wet-applied on site must meet the applicable chemical content \nrequirements of SCAQMD Rule 1168, July 1, 2005, Adhesive and Sealant Applications, as \nanalyzed by the methods specified in Rule 1168. The provisions of SCAQMD Rule 1168 do not \napply to adhesives and sealants subject to state or federal consumer product VOC regulations. \n\u2022 \nFor projects outside the U.S., all paints, coatings, adhesives, and sealants wet-applied on site \nmust either meet the technical requirements of the above regulations, or comply with applicable \nnational VOC control regulations, such as the European Decopaint Directive (2004/42/EC), the \nCanadian VOC Concentration Limits for Architectural Coatings, or the Hong Kong Air Pollution \nControl (VOC) Regulation. \n\u2022 \nIf the applicable regulation requires subtraction of exempt compounds, any content of \nintentionally added exempt compounds larger than 1% weight by mass (total exempt compounds) \nmust be disclosed.  \n",

Composite wood, as defined by the California Air Resources Board, \nAirborne Toxic Measure to Reduce Formaldehyde Emissions from Composite Wood Products Regulation, \nmust be documented to have low formaldehyde emissions that meet the California Air Resources Board \nATCM for formaldehyde requirements for ultra-low-emitting formaldehyde (ULEF) resins or no added \nformaldehyde resins. \n \nSalvaged and reused architectural millwork more than one year old at the time of occupancy is \nconsidered compliant, provided it meets the requirements for any site-applied paints, coatings, adhesives, \nand sealants. \n \nFurniture evaluation. New furniture and furnishing items must be tested in accordance with ANSI/BIFMA \nStandard Method M7.1\u20132011. Comply with ANSI/BIFMA e3-2011 Furniture Sustainability Standard, \nSections 7.6.1 (for half credit, by cost) OR 7.6.2 (for full credit, by cost), using either the concentration \nmodeling approach or the emissions factor approach. Model the test results using the open plan, private \noffice, or seating scenario in ANSI/BIFMA M7.1, as appropriate. USGBC-approved equivalent testing \nmethodologies and contaminant thresholds are also acceptable. For classroom furniture, use the \nstandard school classroom model in CDPH Standard Method v1.1. Documentation submitted for furniture \nmust indicate the modeling scenario used to determine compliance.  \n \nSalvaged and reused furniture more than one year old at the time of use is considered compliant, \nprovided it meets the requirements for any site-applied paints, coatings, adhesives, and sealants. \n \n \n",
