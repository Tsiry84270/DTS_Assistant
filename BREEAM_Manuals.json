If you are looking to assess existing residential assets, \nplease refer to SD 243 technical manual for BREEAM In-Use International: Residential. \nThe primary aim of BREEAM In-Use is to mitigate the operational impacts of existing assets on the \nenvironment.  \nClients can measure, evaluate and reflect the performance of their new assets against best practice in \nan independent, cost-effective and robust manner. The BREEAM In-Use International assessment \nprocess is broken down into two Parts: \n1. Asset Performance: benchmarking the performance of the asset, outlining areas of best \npractice, as well as potential scope for improvement. \n2. Management Performance: benchmarking the building management processes used within \nan asset, outlining areas of best practice, as well as potential to reach optimal asset \nperformance. \nThe outcome of a BREEAM In-Use International assessment is a certified BREEAM In-Use rating for \nthe Parts which an assessment is undertaken against. All Parts can be assessed and certified in \nisolation, and each will receive an independent rating, reflecting performance across the environmental \ncategories listed in Table 2.  \nThe process enables performance levels to be benchmarked, providing the platform for informed \nmanagement decisions to be made, helping to optimise performance. Through on-going assessments, \nBREEAM In-Use International encourages continual improvement. \nTable 2: BREEAM In-Use International environmental categories \nEnvironmental category \nPurpose \nManagement \nEncourages sustainable management practices throughout the life \ncycle of the asset, ensuring that both technical and non-technical \nbuilding users have appropriate guidance on how they can help \nmaximise sustainable performance. This enables assets to put in place \nclear targets and provide feedback loops to ensure that processes can \nbe optimised moving forward. \nHealth and Wellbeing \nEncourages assets to provide healthy, safe, comfortable and \naccessible environments, both internally and externally, for their \nbuilding users. \nEnergy \nEncourages the reduction of energy use by recognising building with \nlower operational energy consumption and carbon emissions over the \nlifetime of the asset. It assesses the inherent energy efficiency of the \nbuilding fabric, installed servicing systems and renewable energy \ngeneration capacity. \nTransport \nEncourages the provision of improved access to local amenities and to \nsustainable means of transport, i.e. public transport and other \nalternative transport solutions for building users. This enables solutions \nthat support a reduction in car journeys and, therefore, congestion and \nCO\u2082 emissions over the life of the asset. \n"

This ensures the asset focuses on \nidentifying means of reducing potable water consumption (internal and \nexternal) over the lifetime of the building and minimising losses through \nleakage. \nResources \nEncourages the prudent and responsible use of resources including \nmaterials and waste. To reduce whole life impacts from resource use \nthe category requires users to consider the environmental impacts of \nthe operations for the life of an asset. The category encourages users \nto evaluate resource use within the context of a circular economy and \nwaste in accordance with the waste hierarchy. \nResilience \nEncourages consideration of an asset\u2019s exposure to a range of risks \nsuch as; climate-related physical risks and local watercourse pollution, \nexcess material damage, and physical security. Then encourages the \npro-active management of these risks to minimise their impact and \nensure rapid recovery. \nLand Use and Ecology \nEncourages assets to gain an awareness of the current and potential \necological value on-site, and the potential impact the operation of the \nasset has on this value. This enables long-term strategies, including \nthose for management and maintenance, to be established that will \nprotect and enhance ecological value in the future \nPollution \nEncourages the prevention and control of both airborne and waterborne \npollution associated with the asset\u2019s location and use. Then \nencourages the asset to pro-actively minimise the risk of pollution on \nsurrounding communities and environments, as well as managing the \ntransition risks associated with refrigerants. \nThe value of data collection \nReal estate owners, occupiers, developers and funders around the world are facing ever increasing \ndemands to address Corporate Social Responsibility. This results in a need to have clear reporting \nprocesses related to the assets they own, manage and occupy. \nBy gathering, analysing and sharing data trends related to the performance of these assets, BREEAM \nIn-Use can help clients to develop a common understanding of how their assets perform, outlining the \nareas which present the largest opportunity for improvement.  \nAssessing an asset according to BREEAM In-Use means a client can: \n\u2022 \nSet key performance indicators for energy, water, waste and greenhouse gas performance. \n\u2022 \nUnderstand the performance of assets within their portfolios. \n\u2022 \nBenchmark individual assets against other assets within owner portfolios. \n\u2022 \nOptimise the performance of their assets through good management, maintenance and \noccupation policies and procedures. \n\u2022 \nSet performance improvement targets and measure progress over time. \n"

Each Part consists of individual assessment issues across the various BREEAM \nenvironmental categories. Each assessment issue addresses a specific building related environmental \nimpact or issue and is assigned a number of credits. \nBREEAM credits are awarded where an asset meets the best practice performance levels defined for \nan assessment issue, i.e. the impact has been mitigated. For example, in the case of the health and \nwellbeing category, a specific building occupant-related issue has been addressed, e.g. thermal \ncomfort. \nThe number of credits available for an individual assessment issue will vary and generally reflect the \nimportance of mitigating the impact of the assessment issue. In most cases, where there are multiple \ncredits available, the number awarded is based on a sliding scale or benchmark, where progressively \nhigher standards of building performance are rewarded with a higher number of credits. \nIn addition to the category score, overall score and BREEAM rating, verified performance against \nindividual assessment issues also provides users with a credible set of key building performance \nindicators for a range of building impacts. It is therefore possible to use the method to define \nperformance levels in support of specific organisational policy objectives for individual environmental \nissues as well as using BREEAM to define overall targets. However, be aware that cost implications \ncan occur if targets are set using individual issues and credit levels. \nCredits for exemplary-level performance \nBREEAM seeks to support higher levels of performance within the built environment. One way it does \nthis is through the availability of additional credits to recognise sustainability-related benefits or \nperformance levels not currently recognised by standard BREEAM assessment issues and criteria. This \nrewards developments that go beyond established best practice in a particular aspect of sustainability. \nAwarding credits for exemplary level of performance enables clients to boost their building\u2019s BREEAM \nperformance. BREEAM In-Use currently awards exemplary-level credits, where assets meet exemplary \nperformance criteria defined within an existing BREEAM issue, i.e. going beyond the standard BREEAM \nassessment criteria. \nEach exemplary-level credit achieved adds 1% to an asset's overall score. The maximum number of \n\u2018exemplary-level credits\u2019 that can be awarded for any one asset is 10 per Part; therefore, the maximum \nadditional score available is 10%. \nExemplary-level credits can be awarded regardless of the asset\u2019s final BREEAM rating, i.e. they can be \nawarded at any BREEAM rating level, and no assessment can exceed 100% for the overall score. \nTable 10: Exemplary level credits \nPart \nIssue \nAnswer Option \nCredits \nAsset Performance \nHea 01 \u2013 Daylighting \nOption F \n1 \nAsset Performance \nHea 12 \u2013 Inclusive design \nOption F \n1 \nAsset Performance \nEne 10 \u2013 Demand side management \n(DSM) capabilities for electricity \nN/A \n4 \nAsset Performance \nWat 01 \u2013 Water monitoring \nOption F \n1 \n"

The percentage of available credits achieved in each category is then multiplied by the \ncorresponding weighting for each category to give the overall environmental category score. \n4. The category scores are added together to give the overall BREEAM In-Use International score \nfor the Part being assessed. \n5. The overall score is compared with the BREEAM rating benchmark levels and, provided all \nminimum standards have been met, the relevant BREEAM rating is achieved. \n6. An additional 1% can be added to the final BREEAM In-Use International score for each \nexemplary-level credit achieved with the total BREEAM In-Use International score capped at \n100%. The maximum number of \u2018exemplary-level credits\u2019 that can be awarded for any one \nasset is 10 per Part; therefore, the maximum additional score available is 10%. \n \n"

The BREEAM In-Use International \nAssessor's assessment report and the BRE Global Quality Assurance and certification process are core \nelements of BREEAM, and they are designed to ensure that clients can have confidence in the \nBREEAM In-Use International rating determined by the Assessor. \nTo maintain consistency and confidence certification requires that, all assessment decisions be based \non verified and credible information that can be traced, i.e. decisions are evidence based. This is not \nonly important for compliance with the international standards to which BRE Global is accredited as a \ncertification body, but also manages risk to clients and BREEAM In-Use International Assessors in the \nevent that a certification outcome is challenged. \nThe BREEAM In-Use International Assessor role \nThe role of the BREEAM In-Use International Assessor is to gather information in a competent and \nimpartial manner and use it to assess performance against the BREEAM scheme. To award a BREEAM \ncredit, the Assessor must be satisfied that the evidence gathered demonstrates unambiguous \ncompliance with all relevant criteria defined in the BREEAM scheme. All evidence must be referenced \nappropriately by the Assessor in their assessment submissions and made available to BRE Global Ltd \nfor quality assurance checks. \nWithin each BREEAM issue, the BREEAM In-Use International Assessor must determine the level of \nperformance within the relevant spaces. Where a consistent level of performance is not provided across \nthe entire asset for a particular issue, the final score for that issue is determined by the space with the \nlowest level of performance. This applies to all BREEAM In-Use International issues for all \nassessments, unless stated within the respective issue. Where an asset is made from a variety of asset \ntypes, the Assessor must provide evidence that demonstrates the level of performance from each asset \ntype for each issue. For example, where there is retail and office space within a single assessment, the \nsample of evidence must include documentation for each type. This should be supported by a \nverification statement from the Assessor outlining what has been witnessed and verified during the site \nvisit, clarifying the situation to BRE Global quality assurance. \nClear, ordered and well referenced evidence for each BREEAM issue and criterion facilitates efficient \nquality assurance and a certification decision. The submission of Assessor Verification Comments and \nthe collection and referencing of evidence can all be undertaken within the BREEAM In-Use \nInternational Online Platform.  \nThe evidence file name should include the BREEAM In-Use International Issue reference number as \nwell as the name of the document/file (e.g. Rsc01_Condition survey) to ensure ease of reference in the \nBREEAM In-Use International Assessor\u2019s comments and for Quality Assurance. \nIf large, multipage documents are used as evidence, the BREEAM In-Use International Assessor should \nhighlight the page or section of the document that demonstrates compliance and reference this \nspecifically in their Assessor verification comments.  If photos are used as evidence, these must clearly \nshow how compliance with a criterion is sought and, where needed, be annotated.  Photos must also \nbe date stamped to confirm when they were taken. \nThe BREEAM In-Use International Assessor determines the BREEAM rating and the submission of \nAssessor Verification Comments via the BREEAM In-Use International Online Platform. This formal \nrecord of an Assessor\u2019s audit against the criteria defined in the technical manual for a BREEAM \nscheme. The BREEAM certificate issued by BRE Global provides assurance that the service provided \nby the Assessor, i.e. the assessment and determination of the BREEAM rating has been conducted in \naccordance with the requirements of the scheme. \n"

In many instances, the Assessor should source readily available and prepared information \nto demonstrate compliance. For this reason, BREEAM aims to avoid being prescriptive on the type of \nevidence required, although some issues do require specific documents. \nThe BREEAM In-Use International Assessor will find that many assessment issues require more than \none piece or type of information to demonstrate compliance with one criterion. Alternatively, one piece \nof information may be sufficient to demonstrate compliance with multiple criteria. \nTo help the BREEAM In-Use International Assessor understand how the different types of \ndocumentation they collate can be used as evidence, evidence types are grouped broadly into three \ncategories: \n1) General evidence includes a broad list of defined information commonly produced for an asset. \nOne or more pieces of this type of information can be used to demonstrate compliance for one or \nmore of the assessment issues and criteria, as deemed appropriate by the BREEAM In-Use \nInternational Assessor. \nGeneral BREEAM evidence types are listed in Table 13 and not specifically in the Evidence section \nwithin each BREEAM issue. Not all general evidence types will be appropriate for all assessment \nissues and it is the responsibility of the BREEAM In-Use Assessor to ensure that the evidence \nprovided specifically demonstrates compliance and is fully referenced in the assessment \nsubmission. \n2) Specific evidence is particular information that must be provided to verify compliance with the \nrelevant criteria for the BREEAM credit sought. In all cases this is the only type of evidence \nacceptable to BRE Global Ltd for that particular issue or criterion. If the specific evidence is not \nprovided and referenced appropriately in the assessment submission, the Quality Assurance audit \nwill identify it as a non-conformity and a certification decision will be delayed until such time as the \nnon-conformity is addressed. \nWhen required, specific evidence is defined and listed in the Evidence section of the assessment \nissue. Specific evidence required to demonstrate compliance with particular criteria is listed but this \nevidence alone may not be sufficient to demonstrate full compliance. Additional general evidence \ntypes may also be required. Not all BREEAM In-Use issues have specific evidence requirements. \n3) Other types of evidence provided by a client not listed in Table 13 or the \u2018Evidence\u2019 section for \neach issue, can still be used. To avoid non-conformities and delays in certification, other types of \nevidence must be credible, robust and traceable to the same assurance level as, or better than, \nspecified or general evidence types defined in the technical manual. If in doubt, BRE should be \ncontacted prior to awarding credits and referencing such evidence in the submission for QA and \ncertification decision. \nFor some assessment issues, the BREEAM In-Use Assessor will require a mix of general and specific \nevidence types. \nEvidence principles  \nBREEAM Assessors and the BRE Global Ltd Quality Assurance work to the following evidence \nprinciples. \nWhere specific evidence is defined and listed in the \u2018Evidence\u2019 section within each assessment issue, \nthis must be sourced and verified by the BREEAM In-Use International Assessor. \n"

Where sections of a specification or \nbuilding manual are provided, the Assessor should reference the extract and as a minimum \nsubmit the front and contents page of the document detailing the project name, revision number \nand date. Specifications must always refer to operational conditions. \no \nPhotographic evidence: This should be dated and have a title/description to clearly link it to the \nasset and issue concerned. \nFor other types of evidence not listed, the BREEAM In-Use International Assessor should use this \nminimum information list as a guide to suitable evidence.

The United Nations has made \u201cGood Health and Wellbeing\u201d one \nof its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with the aim to \u201censure healthy lives and promote wellbeing \nfor all at all ages\u201d (Goal 3). On average, people spend over 90% of their lives in and around buildings and much \nof the rest of their time travelling between them. Consequently, the built environment is critical to our health and \nwellbeing as a result of the conditions and facilities that it provides and the behaviours that it encourages. \nAdditionally, staff costs typically contribute 90% of the total financial burden associated with a building-based \nbusiness. The impact of productivity, attraction and retention, and general employee satisfaction on the bottom \nline means that staff wellbeing is vital to business success. The environments in which staff work, live and play \nare fundamental to all these factors. There is well established evidence that shows that the internal \nenvironmental conditions in buildings, including visual comfort, indoor air quality, thermal comfort and acoustic \ncomfort, can have a significant impact on our physical and mental health. Health impacts associated with \nbuildings include eyestrain, cardiovascular and coronary problems, bronchial complaints including asthma and \nallergies, dermatological complaints, musculoskeletal problems and a range of psychological impacts such as \nfatigue, stress, anxiety and depression. Higher risk individuals, including: the young, elderly, disabled and sick, \ncan experience a range of other health impacts arising from their environment, many of which can have major \nand sometimes life-threatening effects. \n \n \n \nAsset Performance: \nHealth and Wellbeing \n \n20% \n"

For occupied spaces with tinted or diffusing glazing, it is necessary to apply a glass transmittance \nweighting to the glazed area to floor area percentage. For clear or low emissivity single, double or \ntriple glazing, no weighting correction is required. For tinted or diffusing glazing, the glazing to floor \narea percentage is multiplied by T/0.8, where T is the light transmittance of the glazing (expressed as \na decimal). If the glass transmittance is not known, the glazing to floor area percentage is multiplied \nby 0.25 for tinted glazing and by 0.60 for diffusing glazing. \n6. For each relevant occupied space, check that no part of the occupied space is more than x metres on \nplan from the glazed area, where x is three times the height of the top of the glazed area above the \nfloor level. For example, if the height to the top of a glazed area from the floor is 3m, then no part of \nthe occupied space must be further than 9m from the glazed area. Where an occupied space does \nnot meet this distance requirement, it is not possible for the space to comply with the minimum \nperformance requirements. \n7. For each relevant occupied space, check if there are any external obstructions (e.g. adjacent \nbuildings or structures, trees or hedges, etc.) that will potentially limit the amount of daylight reaching \nthe space. If there is an obstruction, its horizontal distance away from the glazing must be greater \nthan its height above the centre of the glazing. For example, if an obstruction\u2019s height is 10m above \nthe centre of the glazing, then the obstruction must be at least 10m away from the glazing. Where an \nobstruction does not meet this distance requirement, the obstructed glazing does not count towards \nthe total glazed area in the calculation. \n"

Where the best practice standard does not stipulate \nprocedures for measuring illuminance, the procedure in the methodology \nsection must be followed.

The deviation of the calibration values as per the \ncalibration certificate should be applied when analysing the measurement results. Additionally, it should \nbe checked that the ambient temperature during the measurements does not depart markedly from the \nambient temperature for which the photocell had been calibrated (typically, this is 25\u00b0C); if this is the \ncase, then the measured values should also be corrected for ambient temperature.  \n"

In the case of illuminance meters that have a detachable photocell, the photocell \nshould be secured inside a specially designed holder and the holder should be checked for the correct \nlevelling on the measurement surface.  \n\u2022 \nThe mains voltage supply in the test areas should be stable during measurements.  \n\u2022 \nIt should be checked that there are no unusual temperature differences between different zones of the \ntest areas. The artificial lighting should also be kept on long enough so that its light output stabilises \n(e.g. at least 20 minutes for fluorescent, discharge or LED lighting).  \n\u2022 \nIndoor illuminance measurements should be carried out so that daylight penetration is avoided \ncompletely whilst taking the readings. In spaces with windows, illuminance measurements would ideally \nbe undertaken after dusk; if blinds are fitted, these should be closed in order to minimise any potential \nstray light from buildings nearby and external lighting. Measurements of outdoor illuminance should be \ncarried out when it is fully dark and in good weather conditions.  \n\u2022 \nItems within the measurement areas should be kept to a level that would be expected during normal \nuse. Additionally, the suitably qualified person should be far enough away from the photocell, ideally \nbelow its height if possible, to avoid casting shadows or preventing light from being reflected onto the \nphotocell.  \n\u2022 \nIlluminance measurements are normally required to assess average illuminance or illuminance \nuniformity on the working plane or other task areas that can be horizontal, vertical or inclined. In existing \nbuildings, task areas, e.g. fixed desks, inclined planes of industrial equipment or vertical storage rack \nfaces, are generally known. In an open task area, a grid of measurement points should be set out. The \ndistance between the measurement points p is calculated using the formula:  \n\ud835\udc91 = \ud835\udfce. \ud835\udfd0 \ud835\udc99 \ud835\udfd3(\ud835\udc8d\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc88\ud835\udfcf\ud835\udfce\ud835\udc85) \nWhere d is the length of the longer dimension of the area being measured, and thus the number of points in the \nrelevant dimension is given by the nearest whole number of d/p. The resulting spacing between the grid points \nis used to calculate the nearest whole number of grid points in the other dimension. Once illuminance is \nmeasured at each grid point, average illuminance can be determined as the arithmetic mean of the measured \nvalues. Illuminance uniformity can be calculated as the ratio of the minimum illuminance (as measured) to the \naverage illuminance (as calculated).  \n\u2022 \nFor horizontal task planes, a perimeter zone of 0.5m from the walls can be excluded from the \nmeasurement area except when a task area is in or extends into this perimeter zone.  \n\u2022 \nAlternatively, spot readings of illuminance may be taken at all locations where people are working, for \nexample on each desk in an open plan office. This is acceptable practice where measurement grids \ncannot be defined due to the presence of obstructions in the measured areas. An occupied space is \ndeemed compliant if both the average illuminance and the average uniformity ratio (given by minimum \nilluminance divided by average illuminance) are within standard recommendations. \n\u2022 \nFor spaces with more than one type of task area, each with different best practice illuminance levels, \ncompliance is achieved if the average illuminance and the average uniformity ratio for all task area \ntypes are within the best practice recommendations. \n\u2022 \nFor assets with identical lighting systems and floor layouts across multiple areas or floors, illuminance \nlevels in a representative sample of areas or floors may be measured, if in the professional opinion of \nthe suitably qualified person, these are likely to give measurements that reflect the performance of the \nlighting in all relevant spaces within the asset.

Exhausts or other pollutant sources are not to be discharged \ninto enclosed external spaces, such as courtyards, in which intakes are also \nlocated. \nC \nMethodology \nPollutant dispersion modelling \nIf compliance cannot be demonstrated using the methods stipulated in the assessment criteria, it may be \nfeasible to demonstrate compliance using pollutant dispersion modelling if this shows that, under normal asset \noperational and typical external environmental conditions, the location of the asset's air intakes and exhausts \nin relation to each other and sources of external pollution minimises the entry of air pollutants into the asset. \nThis can be achieved using either wind tunnel modelling or numerical modelling. Pollutant dispersion modelling \nin urban areas is complex, so it is important that the person carrying out the modelling is a competent individual. \nJet exhaust systems \nJet exhaust systems may be used as an alternative method of demonstrating compliance with criterion 1 if \nevidence from pollutant dispersion modelling demonstrates that the location and separation of air intakes and \nthe jet exhausts, the jet exhaust nozzle direction, and the average jet exhaust velocity prevents significant \nrecirculation of exhaust air under typical wind conditions. \nEvidence \nCriteria \nEvidence requirement \n- \nThe evidence below is not exhaustive, please also refer to the \u2018BREEAM evidential requirements\u2019 \nsection in the scope of the Guidance for appropriate evidence types which can be used to \ndemonstrate compliance. \nAll \nDocumentation (e.g. plans, photographs or scaled drawings of the asset) showing the location of \nair intakes and exhausts and external sources of pollution and the distances between them. \nDefinitions \nCompetent individual \u2013 wind tunnel modelling:  \nAn individual with the following qualifications and experience: \n\u2012 \nHolds a degree or equivalent qualification in a relevant engineering field (mechanical, chemical), \nphysics, mathematics, or meteorology AND holds a membership of an appropriate professional body. \n"

Various numerical models are commercially available which may be used to investigate the \nlocation of ventilation intakes and exhausts, including those based on empirical methods and computational \nfluid dynamics (CFD). \nSources of external pollution:  \nThese include but are not limited to the following: \n\u2012 \nHighways and the main access roads associated with the asset \n\u2012 \nCar parks, delivery and vehicle pick-up, drop-off or waiting bays \n\u2012 \nOther building-related emissions, including from building services exhausts, industrial or agricultural \nprocesses, and external smoking areas. \nService and access roads with restricted and infrequent access, e.g. roads used only for waste collection, are \nunlikely to represent a significant source of external pollution. These roads can therefore be excluded from \nassessment. \nWind tunnel modelling:  \nThis is a versatile physical technique which allows many variables (for example building design, intake and \nexhaust positions, local pollutant sources, wind speed and direction), to be investigated for complex urban \nareas. Wind tunnel modelling provides reliable and detailed data, both visual and quantitative, on outdoor \npollution distribution. This enables the effective siting of intakes and exhausts to be evaluated for both \nmechanically and naturally ventilated buildings. \n"

Issues in this section assess \nthe inherent energy efficiency of the building fabric, the energy efficiency of installed services systems and \ninstalled renewable energy generation capacity. This category also encourages the installation of energy \nmonitoring and energy management capabilities to support efficient energy management and the avoidance of \nwaste throughout the life of the asset. \nContext \nClimate change is the biggest environmental challenge that the world is currently facing. It is already resulting \nin higher global temperatures, greater risk flooding and more extreme weather events. It is mainly due to rising \nlevels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, such as methane, in the atmosphere create a \n\u2018greenhouse effect\u2019, that is causing the Earth to warm. Greenhouse gas emissions have increased by about \n45% since before the industrial revolution and this is almost entirely due to human activity.  \nThe observed increase in greenhouse gas emissions is mainly caused by the burning of fossil fuels for energy, \nagriculture, deforestation and industrial processes. Worldwide, buildings and construction together account of \n39% of energy related carbon emissions, the majority of which is due to energy consumption in use. The impact \non people and communities from climate change and energy generation must be recognised.  Poorer \ncommunities are disproportionately impacted by the negative effects of climate change and energy generation \nfrom fossil fuels, contributing to poor health, higher mortality rates and higher risks of severe damage from \nextreme weather events. \nThe Paris Agreement, ratified in 2016, reflects a desire to accelerate the global response to the threat of climate \nchange by limiting global temperature rise this century to at least 2oC, and preferably 1.5oC, above pre-industrial \nlevels. Subsequently, in October 2018 the urgency of the need to tackle climate change was highlighted by an \nIPCC Special Report which indicates that it will be necessary to limit this increase to 1.5oC to avoid the most \nsevere impacts of climate change. The report concludes that to limit the increase to 1.5oC CO2 emissions must \nreduce by around 45% from 2010 levels by 2030, and to reach net zero emissions by 2050. The United Nations \nincluded clean energy as one of their SDGs (Goal 7) and target \u2018doubling the rate of improvement in energy \nefficiency\u2019 and \u2018increasing substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix\u2019 by 2030. This \nscale of reduction will require rapid and far-reaching transitions for all energy systems, including buildings. \nIt is therefore vital to substantially reduce the total operational energy use in buildings and to increase use of \nrenewable energy sources where possible, if the worse effects of climate change are to be avoided. Addressing \nclimate change and shifting the way in which we produce and use energy can help address inequities such as \nfuel poverty that are currently present in our communities and provide a healthy environment for all demographic \nand economic groups, especially those that are part of less advantaged or underserved communities.   \n \n \n \n \nAsset Performance:  \nEnergy \n \n25% \n"

It describes the scope \nof the asset calculator and how answers to the questions that feed into the asset calculator influence the asset \nenergy performance score.  \nThe asset calculator measures the energy performance that the building is capable of, given its envelope and \ninstalled services.  \nThe building services that are considered in the asset calculator are heating, cooling, heating distribution, \ncooling distribution, lighting, ventilation and hot water. Energy use by other installed building services, e.g. lifts, \nexternal lighting and building management systems, is not included in the asset calculator. \nThe asset energy performance score does not currently take account of the orientation of the building or the \nlocal environment around the building, e.g. overshadowing, but does take account of the building geometry. \nThe asset energy performance score reflects how the asset would be expected to perform compared to another \nasset with a similar function, e.g.an office, if it were typically operated and had a typical occupancy pattern. For \nthese reasons, the assessed energy performance of the asset is likely to be very different from that calculated \nfor the asset energy performance. If a building service is not present in the assessed asset, the energy \nconsumption for the relevant end use will be zero, but the energy use for the relevant end use will not be \nremoved from the standard version of the asset. This means that the energy performance benefits of naturally \nventilated buildings will be recognised. \nThe asset calculator is valuable for indicating areas where improvements to specific system and fabric \ncomponents are likely to lead to a significant increase in the assessed energy performance. More detailed \nconsideration of the expected energy benefits associated with specific measures should be undertaken before \nmaking improvements to the asset. \nModelling approach \nThe energy consumption and hence the annual kgCO2eq emissions per m2 for the asset are calculated using a \nsimplified energy modelling approach.  \nInstead of carrying out a detailed \u201cbottom up\u201d energy modelling calculation, the BREEAM In-Use asset energy \nperformance score is calculated relative to that expected for a standard asset to determine the end use energy \nconsumption.  \nThis approach avoids the need to explicitly determine the energy service requirements (e.g. internal \ntemperatures and lighting levels), occupancy patterns and climate as these are already included in the BREEAM \nIn-Use benchmarks. \nBecause the methodology calculates the energy consumption relative to the BREEAM In-Use benchmarks \nwhich are based on measured energy consumption data, the asset energy performance scores implicitly take \ninto account typical energy management and building operational practices and will therefore more closely relate \nto the assessed energy consumption than would be the case for bottom up modelling. The asset energy \ncalculator uses a simplified energy modelling approach. This takes account of the expected energy demands \nand efficiencies associated with each end use and uses a heat balance approach to take account of factors that \naffect the demand for heating and cooling. For example, more energy efficient lighting will reduce the internal \nheat gains within the asset leading to a decreased demand for cooling energy in the summer but increased \nheating energy use in the winter.  \nThe component and sub component elements that contribute to determining the energy consumption for each \nof the end uses considered in the asset energy calculator are shown in Table 17. \n"

The hot water \ngenerator efficiency improvement factor is therefore determined by: \nHot water generator improvement factor = (1/efficiencyasset)/(1/efficiencystd) \nHot water system efficiency \nThe efficiency of the hot water system includes the hot water generator efficiency and any distribution losses. \nThe asset calculator assumes that there will be no heat losses associated with local generation systems, and \napplies a 10% heat loss for centralised systems and a 20% heat loss for district heating systems. \nHot water system efficiency improvement factor = Hot water generation improvement factor x \n(1+lossesasset)/(1+lossesstd) \nEnergy and carbon emissions from hot water \nEnergy consumption for hot water is then calculated based on the hot water improvement factor as follows: \nAsset hot water energy use (kWh/m2 per year) = overall hot water improvement factor x benchmark hot water \nenergy use (kWh/m2 per year)  \nAsset hot water carbon emissions (kgCO2eq/m2 per year) = Asset hot water energy use * fuel CO2 emission \nfactor  \nCarbon emissions from on-site renewable electricity generation. \nThe energy performance calculation takes account of the carbon benefits associated with renewable \nelectricity generated on-site by assigning a zero-emission factor on-site renewable electricity generation.  \nOverall asset energy performance and credits \nThe overall asset energy performance score is then calculated by summing the calculated carbon savings for \nall end uses and comparing this to benchmark carbon emissions. \nImprovement potential \nIn addition to calculating the energy performance, the asset calculator also generates outputs which indicate \nareas where scope for improving energy performance may exist. An example of the output generated is \nprovided below in Figure 7. \n"

This \nfacilitates travel modes that support a reduction in car journeys, and consequently, congestion and CO\u2082 \nemissions over the life of the asset while encouraging physical activity to improve human health. \nContext \nCities around the world are actively looking at ways of improving quality of life, air quality, congestion and the \nease of movement of people through urban environments. Goal 11 of the United Nations\u2019 SDGs focuses on \nsustainable cities and communities, and recommends \u2018to bike, walk or use public transportations to keep our \ncities\u2019 air clean\u2019. One of its targets is to \u2018provide access to safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport \nsystems for all, improving road safety, notably by expanding public transport by 2030\u2019.  \nReduction in the use of private car trips is a key focus area and there are increasingly stronger controls on \nprivate car use to reduce dependency on them. Alternative transport options such as cycling offer a route to \naddressing transport-related greenhouse gas emissions as well as reducing congestion.  \nClear links between the air quality and heart and brain health have been made in numerous scientific studies. \nIt is estimated that outdoor air pollution causes 4.2 million premature deaths annually worldwide. Air pollution \ndamages plants and animals, as well as impacting biodiversity and crop yields. By reducing air pollution levels, \nthe burden of disease from stroke, heart disease, lung cancer and respiratory diseases can be lessened. \n \n \n \nAsset Performance: \nTransport \n \n5% \n"

The fixings should allow both \nthe wheel and frame to be locked securely. Spaces are covered overhead, and the cycle spaces are \nset in or fixed to a permanent structure (building or hardstanding). Alternatively, the cycle storage may \nbe located in a locked structure fixed to, or part of, a permanent structure with appropriate surveillance.  \nb) The distance between each cycle space, and cycle space and other obstructions, e.g. a wall, allows for \nappropriate access to the cycle storage space to enable bikes to be easily stored and accessed. \nc) The facilities are in a prominent site location that is viewable or overlooked from either an occupied \nbuilding or a main access to a building. In the scenario where cycle storage spaces are within the \nbuilding, prominent signage should be provided to advertise their location to building users and cyclists.  \nd) The cycle storage facility has adequate lighting. \ne) The provision of cycle storage that is only suitable for folding bicycles or scooters is not compliant. \nf) \n The majority of racks are within 100m of the main building entrance. \nDrying space:  \nThis should be a specially designed and designated space (a plant room does not comply) and \nheating/ventilation should be adequate.  \nMain building entrance: \nThe main building entrance is the entrance to the assessed building which is directly connected to the main \nbuilding reception, circulation routes, lifts or stairs, and is available to the majority of the building\u2019s staff and \nvisitors on arrival. It is not the site entrance (unless the site entrance is also the building entrance, e.g. building \nwith a boundary on a public highway).   \nPublic bicycle sharing systems:  \nBicycle sharing systems are increasingly popular and diverse systems that have appeared over the past few \nyears in major cities, whereby a number of bicycles are made available for shared use amongst people who do \nnot own a bicycle. The central concept of many of the systems is free or affordable access to bicycles for city \ntransport in order to reduce the use of automobiles for short trips inside the city thereby diminishing traffic \ncongestion, noise and air-pollution.  \nRural Location:  \nA rural location is defined in this context as a site clearly not within or on the boundary of a small, medium or \nlarge urban cover. An urban cover will have a population of 3000 people or more, located within a tract of \ncontinuously built- up urban land extending 20 hectares or more. Therefore, the definition of rural includes village \nlocations, green field sites or small urban centres with a population of less 3000 people within a tract of land no \ngreater than 20 hectares. Such locations will most likely be on a local bus route to larger urban areas or other \nlocal towns and may have local shops and other facilities.   \n"

This \nensures that the asset is set up to reduce the use of potable water (both internally and externally) over the \nlifetime of the building. This includes minimising losses through leakage.  \nContext \nWater efficiency has been one of the areas highlighted within the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Goal 6 \n(Clean Water and Sanitation) states that by 2030 we need to \u201csubstantially increase water-use efficiency across \nall sectors and ensure sustainable withdrawals and supply of freshwater to address water scarcity and \nsubstantially reduce the number of people suffering from water scarcity.\u201d \nDue to increasing population densities and high levels of water consumption, globally there are water shortages \nwhich are only likely to get worse over time as water demand is projected to increase by 55% between 2000 \nand 20502. Additionally, the energy required for the extraction, purification, delivery, heating/cooling treatment \nand disposal of water (and wastewater) contributes to climate change and air quality issues. Reducing water \nconsumption by increasing efficient use is, therefore, crucial to try and guarantee enough supply to meet the \nfuture demand and address climate change. \n \n \n \n \n2 OECD (2012a), OECD Environmental Outlook to 2050: The Consequence of Inaction, OECD Publishing, \nParis \n \nAsset Performance: \nWater \n \n11% \n"

This is achieved by encouraging the asset \noperator to better understand the condition and value of the asset, and to maintain or improve its value and the \nconstruction products it contains within it. In addition, a more circular use of waste resources generated during \nthe operation of the asset is encouraged by rewarding appropriate sorting and storing facilities. \nContext \nThe operational phase of an asset life cycle is a very significant consumer of resources and sources of waste \nat the end of useful life. Many key resources are non-renewable and are becoming more scarce, costlier and \nriskier to extract. Furthermore, the supply-chain extraction and processing activity required to create products, \nparticularly from raw materials, frequently leads to social and environmental degradation. The United Nations\u2019 \nSDGs include \u2018responsible consumption and production\u2019 (Goal 12), with a target to \u2018achieve the sustainable \nmanagement and efficient use of natural resources\u2019 and to \u2018substantially reduce waste generation through \nprevention, reduction, recycling and reuse\u2019 by 2030. Therefore, it is essential that the real estate sector does all \nit can to address these challenges by using existing assets for as long as possible; maintaining or increasing \nthe value of the resources they contain; enabling the reuse or recycling of resources in existing assets; \nfacilitating occupants to maximise the reuse and recycling of their waste; minimising resource use overall; \nchoosing reused or recycled resources instead of virgin materials; and using resources that cause less harm to \nsociety and the environment.  \n \n \nAsset Performance: \nResources \n \n13% \n"

This encourages the pro-active management of these risks to minimise their \nimpact and to identify opportunities to enhance resilience of the asset and the community in which it sits to \nensure rapid recovery. While this category focuses on hazard preparedness and response, aspects beyond this \nfocus that contribute to and support the broader resilience of the asset and communities it impacts can be found \nin each of the categories in this standard. \nContext \nFlood risk \nGoal 11 of the United Nations\u2019 SDGs focuses on \u2018sustainable cities and communities\u2019, targeting to \u2018significantly \nreduce the number of deaths and the number of people affected and substantially decrease the direct economic \nlosses relative to global gross domestic product caused by disasters, including water-related disasters\u2019 by 2030. \nMany offices, factories and other non-domestic assets are at a significant risk of flooding, i.e. they have a greater \nthan 1 in 75 chance each year of being flooded. Apart from the initial effects of being flooded, once flood water \nhas been drained, significant resources (time and cost) are required to clean, refit and re-open buildings for \noperation.This has major impacts on business continuity that can be costly and time-consuming to manage. \nUnderstanding the risk of flooding that an asset is exposed to is the first step to managing this risk. \nReducing surface water run-off \nStormwater and other surface water run off can have serious impacts on water quality, public health and local \neconomies.  Managing this run off over the long term can create opportunities for assets and communities to \nutilize rainwater as a resource, invest in resilient infrastructure, revitalize urban waterways and introduce green \nspace that makes communities more liveable and equitable. \nNatural hazard risk assessment \nNatural hazards other than floods also can have major impacts on business continuity that can be costly and \ntime- consuming to manage. Understanding the risks from these acute events facilitates the development and \nadoption of hazard preparation and adaptation strategies to protect human life and asset value. \nDurability \nExposed elements of a building or landscaping are at risk of damage through impact, general dilapidation and \nwear and tear. This can result in significant and unnecessary materials use and waste generation across the \nlife of a building. This can be minimised by risk areas being identified and designed out, and suitable protection \nmeasures being provided. \nSecurity \nFeelings of safety and security are essential to healthy and productive asset occupants. Freedom from crime \nand the fear of crime has a major impact on quality of life, and therefore affects the wellbeing of building \noccupants. At a basic level, providing incident alarms gives comfort and some resilience to these occurrences \nfor building users.  \n \nAsset Performance: \nResilience \n \n13% \n"

To use another example, if only 1 ecological feature is \nappropriate for the asset, they can also implement the additional one in a wider area. \nWhere this is pursued, an SQE must be used to ensure the features are significant for contributing to biodiversity \nand are appropriate, in line with their expert opinion. \n"

This facilitates a reduction in impact on surrounding communities and environment, \narising from flooding and emissions to air, land and water. Addressing pollution can help address the inequities \nthat are currently present in our communities and provide a healthy environment for all demographic and \neconomic groups, including those that are less advantaged or part of a vulnerable population. \nContext \nLocal air quality \nPoor air quality has a detrimental effect on people and other living things. Poorer communities are often \ndisproportionately impacted by pollutants, which research has shown to have lifelong consequences on health \nand welfare. Gases such as nitrous oxides (NO\u2093) can react with other gases and environmental factors, including \nsunlight, to create substances that have a major impact on health and wellbeing. These substances can be \nhighly detrimental to human health. They can be carcinogenic, have respiratory impacts (resulting in asthma \nand other bronchial complaints), have a sensitising effect for allergy suffers and increase instances of heart \ndisease. The United Nations have made \u2018good health and well-being\u2019 one of its SDGs, with an aim to \n\u2018substantially reduce the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water and soil \npollution and contamination\u2019 by 2030. Under this issue, BREEAM seeks to limit emissions from developments \nin operation that have an impact on local air quality. \nRefrigerants \nThe typical refrigerants used in building cooling systems are major greenhouse gases that are many times more \npotent than carbon dioxide in their contribution to global warming and climate change. Although, released in \nmuch smaller quantities they are, nevertheless, a significant contributor to increasing global temperatures. As \nsuch, they are the focus of increasingly strict regulatory controls internationally. Worldwide agreements (such \nas the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)) and its extension, the Kyoto \nProtocol, commits signatories to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and banning the most damaging gases. \nThe agreements seek to shift use to low impact refrigerants over time and so provide a timescale for the phasing \nout of more potent refrigerants. Because the use of the gases is so prolific actions taken to limit their use are \nvital. \nThe use of CFCs and HCFCs as refrigerants has been phased out under the Montreal Protocol, resulting in \nthese substances no longer being used as refrigerants in all new build and most existing situations. The \nindustry\u2019s favoured replacements are currently HFCs which, while less damaging to the ozone layer, have 1,000 \nto 9,000 times greater capacity to warm the atmosphere than carbon dioxide.  Through the Kigali amendment \nto the Montreal Protocol, the world will phase out HFCs starting with high-income countries in 2019, then some \nlow-income countries in 2024 and other signatories in 2028.  However, the use of HFCs will continue to grow \nsignificantly before this phase out is completed.  With 90 percent of refrigerant emissions happening at the end \nof life, the effective disposal of the refrigerants in use is critical. \n \nAsset Performance: \nPollution \n \n9% \n"

In determining the GWP of the refrigerant, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange (IPCC) methodology using a 100-year Integrated Time Horizon (or ITH) should be applied. \nRefrigerant: \nA compound typically found in either a fluid or gaseous state that readily absorbs heat from the environment \nwhen combined with other components such as compressors and evaporators \nAdditional information \nRefrigerants \nThere are three main make-ups of refrigerants: \na) Hydrogenated Fluorocarbon Refrigerants (HFCs) are made up of hydrogen, fluorine, and carbon. \nBecause they do not use a chlorine atom (which is used in most refrigerants) they are known to be \none of the least damaging to our ozone. \nb) Hydrogenated Chlorofluorocarbon Refrigerants (HCFCs) are made up of hydrogen, chlorine, \nfluorine, and carbon. These refrigerants contain minimal amounts of chlorine; they are not as \ndetrimental to the environment as some other refrigerants.  \nc) Chlorofluorocarbon Refrigerants (CFCs) contain chlorine, fluorine and carbon. These refrigerants \ncarry high amounts of chlorine, so they are known for being the most hazardous to the ozone layer.  \nHydrocarbons and ammonia-based refrigerants have low or zero GWP. These are now widely available and \nare valid alternatives to HFCs in all buildings, providing health and safety issues are fully addressed. United \nNations Environment Programme (UNEP) hosts a HCFC Help Centre which contains information about the \nmanagement and phase out of HCFCs and alternatives to HCFCs. Table 27 contains a list of common \nrefrigerant types with a low GWP. \n"

Often, with limitations on what changes can be \nmade whilst a building is still occupied, management practices become paramount in delivering the best \nperformance that is possible from the existing building. \nThe aim of good building management should be to make sure that buildings performs in practice as well as, or \nbetter than, it was designed. This requires the building mangers to first understand how the building is supposed \nto perform and then second, to ensure they have the policies and procedures in place to maintain this \nperformance. Finally, it must be ensured that the performance being delivered meets the needs of the building \noccupants. Additionally, for multi-tenanted assets, it is necessary to communicate this to those managing the \ntenanted spaces. \n \n \n \nManagement Performance: \nManagement \n \n11% \n"

The United Nations has made \u201cGood Health and Wellbeing\u201d one \nof its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (Goal 3) with the aim to \u201censure healthy lives and promote wellbeing \nfor all at all ages\u201d. On average, people spend over 90% of their lives in and around buildings and much of the \nrest of their time travelling between them. Consequently, the built environment is critical to our health and \nwellbeing as a result of the conditions and facilities that it provides and the behaviours that it encourages. \nAdditionally, staff costs typically contribute 90% of the total financial burden associated with a building-based \nbusiness. The impact of productivity, attraction and retention, and general employee satisfaction on the bottom \nline means that staff wellbeing is vital to business success. The environments in which staff work, live and play \nare fundamental to all these factors. There is well established evidence that shows that the internal \nenvironmental conditions in buildings, including visual comfort, indoor air quality, thermal comfort and acoustic \ncomfort, can have a significant impact on our physical and mental health. Health impacts associated with \nbuildings include eyestrain, cardiovascular and coronary problems, bronchial complaints including asthma and \nallergies, dermatological complaints, musculoskeletal problems and a range of psychological impacts such as \nfatigue, stress, anxiety and depression. Higher risk individuals, including: the young, elderly, disabled and sick, \ncan experience a range of other health impacts arising from their environment, many of which can have major \nand sometimes life-threatening effects. \n \n \n \nManagement Performance: \nHealth and Wellbeing \n \n17% \n"

Where it is necessary to deviate from the procedures, the \nSQA should provide a reason for doing so and confirm that the alternative procedures are adequate for \ndemonstrating that the asset meets the acoustic performance requirements. \nMeasurements of airborne and impact sound insulation should be made in accordance with the relevant part of \nthe ISO 16283 series. Measurements should be conducted between one in four pairs of adjacent rooms of each \nroom type or performance requirements category and construction type.  \nMeasurements of reverberation time should be made in accordance with the engineering grade (or better) \nrequirements of ISO 3382-2 and conducted within one in four rooms of each room type of performance \nrequirement category and construction type. In the case of room acoustics where performance standards or \ntargets relate to sound absorption, compliance with the relevant targets can be demonstrated by confirmation \nfrom the SQA that the required amount of sound absorptive material has been applied to relevant spaces, with \nreference to published product or generic data. \nFor measurements of ambient noise, the following guidance should be used: \n1. Noise from both internal sources (e.g. mechanical ventilation systems, plant noise, noise-making \nsystems) and external sources (e.g. traffic noise transmitted via the building fa\u00e7ade) should be included. \nAlso, where windows are openable as part of the ventilation strategy, these should be assumed to be \nopen for the purposes of calculations and measurements. If openable windows are present but do not \nform part of the background or permanent ventilation strategy, then these should be assumed to be \nclosed for the purposes of calculations and measurements. \n2. Noise from occupants and office equipment (e.g. computers) should not be included in the \nmeasurements. \n3. A rate of testing of at least one in 10 rooms or spaces of each performance level shall be subject to on-\nsite performance testing. \n4. Measurements should be made in at least four rooms in which noise levels can be expected to be \ngreatest either because they are on the noisiest fa\u00e7ade or because they are on a naturally ventilated \nfa\u00e7ade. \n5. Where different ventilation strategies are used, measurements should be conducted in rooms utilising \neach strategy. Otherwise, measurements should be made in rooms on the noisiest fa\u00e7ade. \n6. T in LAeq,T is taken as the duration of the normal working day (typically 8 hours between 0900 and 1700). \n7. Measurements need not be made over a period of 8 hours if a shorter measurement period would be \nsuitably representative. In this case, measurements should be made when external noise levels are \nrepresentative of normal conditions throughout the day. \n8.

This includes the energy efficiency of \nthe building fabric, the energy efficiency of installed services systems, installed renewable energy generation \ncapacity and standard equipment associated with the use of the building, for example, office equipment. \nHowever, energy uses associated with specialist processes and equipment loads are excluded. The operational \nenergy performance implicitly takes account of how well energy consumption is managed within the building. \nImprovements in the operational energy performance of the asset are also recognised in this category. \nContext \nClimate change is the biggest environmental challenge that the world is currently facing. It is already resulting \nin higher global temperatures, greater risk flooding and more extreme weather events. It is mainly due to rising \nlevels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, such as methane, in the atmosphere create a \n\u2018greenhouse effect\u2019, that is causing the Earth to warm. Greenhouse gas emissions have increased by about \n45% since before the industrial revolution and this is almost entirely due to human activity.  \nThe observed increase in greenhouse gas emissions is mainly caused by the burning of fossil fuels for energy, \nagriculture, deforestation and industrial processes. Worldwide, buildings and construction together account of \n39% of energy related carbon emissions, the majority of which is due to energy consumption in use. The impact \non people and communities from climate change and energy generation must be recognised.  Poorer \ncommunities are disproportionately impacted by the negative effects of climate change and energy generation \nfrom fossil fuels, contributing to poor health, higher mortality rates and higher risks of severe damage from \nextreme weather events. \nThe Paris Agreement, ratified in 2016, reflects a desire to accelerate the global response to the threat of climate \nchange by limiting global temperature rise this century to at least 2oC, and preferably 1.5oC, above pre-industrial \nlevels. Subsequently, in October 2018 the urgency of the need to tackle climate change was highlighted by an \nIPCC Special Report which indicates that it will be necessary to limit this increase to 1.5oC to avoid the most \nsevere impacts of climate change. The report concludes that to limit the increase to 1.5oC CO2 emissions must \nreduce by around 45% from 2010 levels by 2030, and to reach net zero emissions by 2050. The United Nations \nincluded clean energy as one of its SDGs (Goal 7) and target \u2018doubling the rate of improvement in energy \nefficiency\u2019 and \u2018increasing substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix\u2019 by 2030. This \nscale of reduction will require rapid and far-reaching transitions for all energy systems, including buildings. \nIt is therefore vital to substantially reduce the total operational energy use in buildings and to increase use of \nrenewable energy sources where possible, if the worse effects of climate change are to be avoided.  Addressing \nclimate change and shifting the way in which we produce and use energy can help address inequities such as \nfuel poverty that are currently present in our communities and provide a healthy environment for all demographic \nand economic groups, especially those that are part of less advantaged or underserved communities. \n \nManagement Performance: \nEnergy \n \n27% \n"

There are three \nmain parts to the methodology: establishing the reference benchmark, establishing the assessed building \nCO2eq emissions, and comparing the reference benchmark with the assessed CO2eq emissions to generate a \nrating. \nEstablishing reference benchmark \nThe reference benchmark is set according to the asset subtype being assessed. For assets where more than \none activity carried out (e.g. an office block with a retail unit on the ground floor), the floor area can be divided \ninto a maximum of five different asset subtypes. This reference benchmark for the asset is determined based \non a floor area weighted average for the asset which is adjusted to take account of local climate using the same \ndegree day calculation methodology used for the asset model. Because the reference benchmarks are based \non typical assets comprising a mix of both air conditioned and naturally ventilated spaces the methodology will \nrecognise the lower energy consumption of naturally ventilated properties.  \nEstablishing assessed energy consumption \nThe metered energy consumption is used as the starting point for establishing the actual energy consumption \nfor the assessed asset. It is possible to make the following \u2018corrections\u2019 to the metered energy consumption \ndata: \nWhere the asset does not have consumption data which covers the assessment area only, the asset will need \nto use the BREEAM In-Use International Energy Allocation Calculator when completing the Part 2 Energy \nCategory. This can be accessed through the BREEAM In-Use Assessor extranet, or the BREEAM In-Use online \nplatform. Full guidance explaining the requirements for this method is within this tool. \nThe BREEAM In-Use International Energy Allocation Calculator is intended to be used as part of a BREEAM \nIn-Use International assessment only. It cannot be used to provide accurate energy consumption breakdown in \nmulti-function/system contexts. BRE Global cannot accept any liabilities for variations in the performance of \nbuildings or other assets from the results obtained through the use of this Energy Allocation Calculator, and \ntherefore it should not be used as the basis for making decisions on enhancement and investment actions. \nA final correction is then made to account for consumption data based on any reporting period that is not 365 \ndays. \nUsers are able to enter metered energy consumption for many different fuel types including: grid supplied \nelectricity, natural gas, LPG, gas oil, solid fossil fuels, biodiesel, biogas, wood, district heating and district \ncooling. \nOnce the energy consumption for each fuel type has been entered, the tool calculates the associated CO2eq \nemissions for the assessed asset by multiplying the consumption data by the relevant carbon emission factors \n"

As for the reference baseline, the carbon emission factor for electricity varies according to \nthe country of assessment, but the emission factors for non-electrical consumption are fixed. The only exception \nto this is for district heating and cooling systems where it is possible to enter the actual emissions factor for the \nsystem where known. \nEstablishing final score \nThe operational energy rating is then calculated by comparing the assessed CO2eq emissions to the reference \nCO2eq emissions using a sliding scale with maximum of 50 credits being awarded for a zero carbon building, \nand zero credits awarded where the assessed emissions are more than four times the reference emissions. An \nadditional five exemplary credits are available for buildings that are carbon positive.

Such confirmation will be provided and signed by either\nsomeone internal to the organisation or the Assessor themselves.\nNote: Where this is undertaken by someone other than the Assessor, the Assessor must be satisfied that the \ninformation is correct, and that the individual has a good understanding of metering systems and of the metering \nstrategy of the particular asset being assessed. This should be clearly outlined within the Assessor comments. \nEnergy sources start being used, or stop being used part way through the reporting period \nBREEAM considers the overall consumption for a 12-month period rather than when sources were added or \nchanged during that period. Where an energy source, such as on-site renewable energy generation capacity, \nbegins contributing to or stops contributing to the energy used by the asset part way through the year, the \nstart and end dates entered should still match the reporting period for all energy uses.  \nNon-standard energy consumption: \nThe energy consumption for large energy intensive loads and all external lighting may be subtracted from the \noverall asset energy consumption where it is separately sub-metered.  \nExamples of Non-standard energy uses include: \na.\nRegional server room: Energy used in a server room that services multiple satellite\noffices/servers\nb.\nTrading floor: Energy used in a room where traders are gathered to operate on financial\nmarkets\nc.\nBakery oven: Energy used in a commercial sized oven used to bake foods.\nd.\nSports floodlighting: Energy used by broad-beamed, high intensity artificial lights (often used\noutside)\ne.\nFurnace or forming process:\ni.\nEnergy used in a furnace: an industrial devise used for many things, such as\nextracting metals or as heat source in chemical plants.\nii.\nEnergy used in forming process: a manufacturing process which makes uses of\nsuitable stresses to cause deformation of materials to produce required shapes.\n"

The data requirements and \nmethodology are the same as for the current reporting period and are described in Ene 19 - Ene 21. \nWhere energy consumption data has been entered for the previous reporting period this will be automatically \nextracted from the BREEAM In-Use online platform. \nThe calculation compares the difference in annual carbon emissions between two reporting periods 3-years \napart (i.e. 2016 and 2019 for 2019 assessments). The carbon emissions are calculated based on the annual \nenergy consumption data for the two reporting periods using the current (i.e. 2019) BREEAM CO2 emission \nfactors. This means the carbon improvement of the asset will exclude the impact of external factors such as \ndecarbonisation of the electricity grid. Therefore, the carbon emissions per m2 will be calculated using the \nBREEAM In-Use V6.0.0 CO2 emission factors. \nThe carbon improvement calculation also takes account of changes in the mix of asset subtypes within the asset \nbetween the two reporting periods by measuring the performance improvement relative to the benchmark for \nthe relevant asset subtype.

This \nensures that the asset is set up to reduce the use of potable water (both internally and externally) over the \nlifetime of the building. This includes minimising losses through leakage. \nContext \nWater efficiency has been one of the areas highlighted within the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Goal 6 \n(Clean Water and Sanitation) states that by 2030 we need to \u201csubstantially increase water-use efficiency across \nall sectors and ensure sustainable withdrawals and supply of freshwater to address water scarcity and \nsubstantially reduce the number of people suffering from water scarcity.\u201d \nDue to increasing population densities and high levels of water consumption, globally there are water shortages \nwhich are only likely to get worse over time, with water demand is projected to increase by 55% between 2000 \nand 20502. Additionally, the energy required for the extraction, purification, delivery, heating/cooling treatment \nand disposal of water (and wastewater) contributes to climate change and air quality issues. Reducing water \nconsumption by increasing efficient use is, therefore, crucial to try and guarantee enough supply to meet the \nfuture demand and address climate change. \nSub-metering water means that consumption can be measured and managed properly. Highly-consuming \nelements can be identified, with the aim of encouraging the reduction in water use where practical. Moreover, \nchanges in consumption can be identified and dealt with as appropriate, thereby minimising risks of systems \nfailures which can have costly and disruptive consequences.  \n \n \n \n \nManagement Performance:  \nWater \n \n9% \n"

This is achieved by encouraging the asset \nowner to integrate sustainability considerations into the procurement of construction products (used for \nmaintenance), operational consumables and equipment. In addition, more circular use of waste resources \ngenerated during the use of the asset is facilitated by rewarding data gathering, target setting and engagement \nwith asset users. This is to maximise the repurposing of waste stream resources where appropriate for other \nuses. \nContext \nThe operational phase of an asset life cycle is a very significant consumer of resources and sources of waste \nat the end of useful life. Many key resources are non-renewable and are becoming more scarce, costlier and \nriskier to extract. Furthermore, the supply-chain extraction and processing activity required to create products, \nparticularly from raw materials, frequently leads to social and environmental degradation. The United Nations\u2019 \nSDGs include \u2018responsible consumption and production\u2019 (Goal 12), with a target to \u2018achieve the sustainable \nmanagement and efficient use of natural resources\u2019 and to \u2018substantially reduce waste generation through \nprevention, reduction, recycling and reuse\u2019 by 2030. Therefore, it is essential that the real estate sector does all \nit can to address these challenges by using existing assets for as long as possible; maintaining or increasing \nthe value of the resources they contain; enabling the reuse or recycling of resources in existing assets; \nfacilitating occupants to maximise the reuse and recycling of their waste; minimising resource use overall; \nchoosing reused or recycled resources instead of virgin materials; and using resources that cause less harm to \nsociety and the environment. \n \n \n \nManagement Performance: \nResources \n \n11% \n"

This encourages the pro-active management of these risks to \nminimise their impact and to identify opportunities to enhance resilience of the asset and the community in which \nit sits to ensure rapid recovery. While this category focuses on hazard preparedness and response, aspects \nbeyond this focus that contribute to and support the broader resilience of the asset and communities it impacts \ncan be found in each of the categories in this standard. \nContext \nNatural hazards, fires and other emergencies \n\u2018Climate action\u2019 is one of the United Nations\u2019 SDGs, with a target to \u2018strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity \nto climate-related hazards and natural disasters\u2019. All buildings are exposed to a range of natural and man-made \nhazards. These can damage the assets and impact on the occupants significantly. \nBy understanding hazards that a building is exposed to, good management practice can be implemented to \nminimise impacts, ensure that the asset quickly recovers to \u2018business as usual\u2019. \nClimate Resilience \nBRE defines climate resilience in this context as \u201cThe ability for assets to assess and respond to climate \nchange through the assessment and management of associated risks (transition, social, physical) and the \nability to capitalize on opportunities such as resource efficiency and lower emission energy sources\u201d. \nInvestors are increasingly demanding to understand more about how assets and the portfolios which they \nbelong are assessing the physical risks from climate change and taking action to address them to protect \nasset value. The driving force behind this is the Taskforce on Climate- related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). \nThe TCFD is a global voluntary disclosure framework launched in June 2017 to allow organisations to identify \nthe climate risks and opportunities they expect to face and to encourage the disclosure of those financial \nimpacts to investors. \nSecurity \nFeelings of safety and security are essential to healthy and productive asset occupants. Freedom from crime \nand the fear of crime has a major impact on quality of life, and therefore effects the wellbeing of building \noccupants. Security risks are dependent on the context of a building and, as a result, need to be specifically \ndetermined based against a number of variables, including function and location. In addition to this, security \nrisks are not static and can change over time. Consequently, security advice from the appropriate professionals \nis essential in determining the necessary security measures for any asset. Assets should consider how their \napproach to crime prevention and security may result in inequitable and exclusionary outcomes and solutions. \nAssets are encouraged to adopt policies and procedures that not only protect building users but contribute to \nthe dignity, safety and security of all people and the wider neighbourhood \n \nManagement Performance: \nResilience \n \n11% \n"

This facilitates a reduction in impact on surrounding communities and \nenvironment, arising from flooding and emissions to air, land and water. \nPollution source reduction is a proactive, and ultimately more cost effective and desirable, process than \nfocusing on pollution treatment and disposal. It reduces the financial, societal and environmental costs from \nbuilding operations.  In addition to reducing the risk of significant financial and reputational implications in the \nevent of a pollution incident, addressing pollution can help address the inequities that are currently present in \nour communities and provide a healthy environment for all demographic and economic groups, including \nthose that are less advantaged or part of a vulnerable population. \nContext \nThe United Nations have made \u2018good health and wellbeing\u2019 one of their SDGs, with an aim to \u2018substantially \nreduce the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water and soil pollution and \ncontamination\u2019 by 2030.  \nLight pollution \nThe external lighting used by buildings can have a detrimental impact on the use and enjoyment of neighbouring \nproperties, and on the mental and physical wellbeing of individuals in them. It also has a significant and often \ndetrimental impact on local wildlife. \nRefrigerants \nThe typical refrigerants used in building cooling systems are major greenhouse gases that are many times more \npotent than carbon dioxide in their contribution to global warming and climate change. Although, released in \nmuch smaller quantities they are, nevertheless, a significant contributor to increasing global temperatures. As \nsuch, they are the focus of increasingly strict regulatory controls internationally. Worldwide agreements (such \nas the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)) and its extension, the Kyoto \nProtocol, commits signatories to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and banning the most damaging gases. \nThe agreements seek to shift use to low impact refrigerants over time and so provide a timescale for the phasing \nout of more potent refrigerants. Because the use of the gases is so prolific actions taken to limit their use are \nvital. \nBREEAM supports this agenda and stimulates a more rapid change market transformation by creating market \nvalue for assets with reduced impact refrigerants by limiting the volume or weight of gases used, their potential \nimpact, and for specifying systems which detect and control leakage of gas to the atmosphere. \nRefrigerant leaks impact both the environment and financial performance of an asset, increasing the running \ntime of the equipment and potentially damaging components of the system. Whilst many countries have \nregulatory systems in place that require leak testing and repair for systems of a certain size during regular \n \nManagement Performance: \nPollution \n \n7% \n"

This is applied through a suite of BREEAM schemes covering aspects of the built environment life \ncycle. These schemes are locally developed and operated by a number of different organisations, called National \nScheme Operators (NSOs), across a range of countries.\nFor a full list of BREEAM NSOs and schemes visit the BREEAM website (www.breeam.com).\nThe BREEAM schemes\nBRE Global is the NSO of BREEAM in the UK. We develop and operate a number of BREEAM schemes for the UK and \ninternationally, each designed to assess the environmental performance of developments at various stages in the life \ncycle, and these include:\nBREEAM Communities for the master-planning of a larger community of buildings.\nCEEQUAL for civil engineering, infrastructure, landscaping and public realm works.\nBREEAM New Construction for new-build domestic  and non-domestic buildings.\nHome Quality Mark for new-build dwellings (in the UK only).\nBREEAM In-Use for existing buildings in operation.\nBREEAM Refurbishment and Fit-out for domestic and non-domestic building fit-outs and refurbishments.\nIndependent BREEAM Assessors, trained, qualified and licensed by BRE Global can undertake a BREEAM assessment \nusing this scheme document and associated reporting and calculation tools.\nOnce an assessment is complete and quality assured BRE Global will issue a BREEAM certificate. The BREEAM \ncertificate provides formal verification that the Assessor has completed an assessment of a building in accordance \nwith the requirements of the scheme and its quality standards and procedures.\nA BREEAM certificate provides assurance to any interested party that a building's BREEAM rating, at the time of \ncertification, accurately reflects its performance against the BREEAM standard.\nAnyone wishing to verify the BREEAM rating of a building can do so by either checking its BREEAM certificate, which \nwill contain the certification mark, (see Figure 1 below) or by searching the BREEAM buildings listings on BREEAM \nProjects (www.breeam.com/projects). Examples of a BREEAM New Construction certificate can be found in Appendix \nF \u2013 Examples of BREEAM New Construction certificates on page\u00a0414.\nFigure 1: The BREEAM certification mark\nEnsuring quality and consistency\nAll BREEAM schemes are developed and operated by NSOs in accordance with the Code for a Sustainable Built \nEnvironment.

Appointing a BREEAM Assessor or Advisory Professional early in the \nproject will help in achieving the target rating without undue impacts on the flexibility of design decisions, budgets \nand potential solutions.\nFigure 2 on the next page serves to highlight the link between the BREEAM International New Construction Version \n6 assessment and certification stages and the RIBA Plan of Work 2020.\nThis figure can assist clients in timing their engagement with BREEAM and the appointment of a BREEAM Assessor.\nClients can view up-to-date listings of licensed BREEAM International New Construction Assessors and BREEAM \nAdvisory Professionals on BREEAM Projects (www.breeam.com/projects).\nIt is important to recognise that BREEAM primarily reflects the overall performance of the building rather than just \nthe opportunities or limitations placed on specific stakeholders involved in the procurement process. This means \nthat the client, design team, principal contractor and BREEAM Assessor, as well as other specialist disciplines, have \nan important role to play throughout the procurement process, if the desired performance level is to be achieved \nand reflected through the certified BREEAM rating.\nThe onus of orientating the brief towards sustainability needs to come first and foremost from the client. To \nfacilitate this, BRE Global recommends that clients and their project teams engage with a BREEAM Assessor or \nBREEAM Advisory Professional no later than the Preparation and Briefing stage (RIBA Stage 1 or equivalent) and \nideally sooner where practical. This will ensure that realistic targets are set and can be met, appropriate \nresponsibilities can be defined and understood, and low or no cost solutions to environmental impacts can be \nsought and applied wherever possible.\nTechnical Manual \u2013 Version 6.0.0 \u2013 01/12/2021 \u2013 SD250\n19\n"

Enable qualified and licensed BREEAM Assessors to complete BREEAM assessments and determine a rating\n\u00a02. Enable BRE Global to complete quality assurance reviews of a BREEAM Assessor's assessment report, in \naccordance with the standards to which BRE Global is accredited\n\u00a03. Act as an aid for BREEAM Advisory Professionals (AP) to undertake project team facilitation, in terms of \ndefining, monitoring and successfully achieving the desired BREEAM rating\n\u00a04. Act as a reference for clients and members of the project team whose proposed building is being BREEAM-\nassessed.\nThe scheme document is split into the following parts:\n\u00a01. Introduction to BREEAM\n\u00a02. Scope of the BREEAM International New Construction scheme\n\u00a03. Scoring and rating BREEAM assessed buildings, including minimum standards and BREEAM rating benchmarks\n\u00a04. The BREEAM evidential requirements\n\u00a05. Assessment criteria\n\u00a06. Appendices\n\u00a07. Checklists\nThe Scope section describes the types of buildings and stages of assessment that this BREEAM scheme can be \napplied to. Appendices A to F provide additional scoping guidance for specific building and project types. The Scope \nsection can be used by clients and BREEAM Assessors to check whether this is the correct BREEAM scheme to use for \ntheir project.\nThe Scoring and rating section illustrates how a building's assessed performance is measured and rated. It outlines \nthe BREEAM rating level benchmarks, the minimum BREEAM standards for each rating level and the BREEAM \nenvironmental section weightings. It also includes a description of the BREEAM assessment issues and 'credits', \nincluding BREEAM 'innovation credits', and how performance against these is calculated and expressed as a \nBREEAM rating.\nPlease note that, for the purpose of formal assessment and certification, the building's actual BREEAM performance \nmust be determined by the BREEAM Assessor using the relevant BREEAM reporting and calculation tools.\nThe BREEAM evidential requirements section provides guidance to assessors and project teams on the various \ntypes and forms of evidence required by the BREEAM Assessor to demonstrate compliance with BREEAM criteria. \nThis includes a description of why BREEAM requires an auditable trail of evidence.\nThe Assessment criteria section includes the individual BREEAM assessment issues, categorised in 10 \nenvironmental sections. Each issue defines a level of performance (the assessment criteria) against which the \nassessed building demonstrates compliance (using appropriate project information, i.e. evidence) in order to achieve \na corresponding number of available BREEAM credits.\nThe majority of BREEAM issues and credits are tradable, meaning that a client and their project team can pick and \nchoose which to target in order to build their BREEAM performance score and achieve the desired BREEAM rating. \nSeveral BREEAM issues have minimum standards, meaning that to achieve a particular BREEAM rating specific credits \nor criteria must be achieved (BREEAM's minimum standards are outlined in the Scoring and rating BREEAM-assessed \nbuildings section).\nEach BREEAM issue is structured as follows:\nTechnical Manual \u2013 Version 6.0.0 \u2013 01/12/2021 \u2013 SD250\n21\n"

Therefore to maintain comparability and consistency of the assessment and \nBREEAM rating, a separate assessment score and rating are required for each building type, function or use in the \ndevelopment.\nFurther guidance on how to define mixed-use developments for the purpose of a BREEAM assessment can be found \nin Guidance Note 10 Mixed-use developments and similar buildings (or units). \nPart new-build, part refurbishment projects\nFor developments that are a mixture of new-build and refurbished areas, the choice of scheme depends on the scope \nof the new-build and refurbishment works.\nFor smaller projects, where the total development area is less than 1000m\u00b2, a single BREEAM assessment can be \nundertaken to cover both the new-build and refurbished areas. The BREEAM New Construction or BREEAM \nRefurbishment and Fit-out scheme choice will be based on whichever (new-build or refurbishment) constitutes the \nmajority of the assessed floor area. \nFor larger projects, a single New Construction assessment can be undertaken, as the refurbished areas would then \nhave to reach the more challenging New Construction criteria. If the development is predominantly refurbishment \nwith a new-build extension, then the BREEAM Refurbishment and Fit-out scheme contains thresholds under which a \nsingle Refurbishment and Fit-out assessment can be completed.\nWhere the new extension is above these thresholds and a single BREEAM Refurbishment and Fit-out assessment is \nnot appropriate, there are two options as described below.\nOption 1: Separate BREEAM New Construction and BREEAM Refurbishment and Fit-out assessments\n24\nTechnical Manual \u2013 Version 6.0.0 \u2013 01/12/2021 \u2013 SD250\n"

It refers \nto both the BREEAM Refurbishment and Fit-out manual and the BREEAM New Construction manual. A bespoke \nScoring and Reporting tool is also produced for the project.\nAs part of the bespoke criteria development for issue Ene 01 Reduction of energy use and carbon emissions on \npage\u00a0150 we allow the new-build to be assessed against the New Construction scheme and the refurbishment \nagainst the RFO scheme. The tool performs an area-weighted average score. \nIn determining the appropriate option for a part new-build, part-refurbishment project, the BREEAM Assessor \nshould review the scope of the proposed works and consider in particular the scope of the refurbished elements, i.e. \nis it a major refurbishment, will there be a significant change of use and will the building's thermal and structural \nelements remain \u2018as existing\u2019? Using this information, the assessor should advise the client on the most suitable \noption in terms of which BREEAM version or scheme is most appropriate for maximising the building's \nenvironmental performance.\nBREEAM International New Construction assessment types\nWithin the International New Construction scheme a number of assessment types are defined and can be used to \nassess and rate a new building's performance. These are:\nNon-residential\nFully fitted \nShell and core (see Appendix D \u2013 Shell and core project assessments on page\u00a0409)\nShell only (see Appendix D \u2013 Shell and core project assessments on page\u00a0409)\nResidential\nFully fitted (see Appendix E \u2013 Applicability of BREEAM New Construction to single and multiple \ndwellings, partially and fully fitted on page\u00a0412)\nPartially fitted (see Appendix E \u2013 Applicability of BREEAM New Construction to single and multiple \ndwellings, partially and fully fitted on page\u00a0412).\nThe assessment criteria for these options are clearly identified in this technical manual. The assessor, in collaboration \nwith the client and design team as necessary, should determine which BREEAM assessment type is relevant for their \nproject.\nSimilar building types (or units) on the same site\nIt is possible to assess and rate a number of separate but similar non-residential buildings, or individual units within \na larger building development, within one BREEAM assessment report. Further guidance on this type of assessment \ncan be found  in Guidance Note 10 Mixed use developments and similar buildings (or units). \nShell and core, speculative buildings\nNon-fitted out \u2018speculative\u2019 new buildings, often referred to as shell and core buildings, can be assessed using the \nBREEAM International New Construction scheme.

Assessment and ideally certification will occur prior to the beginning of operations \non site. The BREEAM rating at this stage is labelled as \u2018interim\u2019 because it does not represent the building\u2019s final, \nnew construction BREEAM performance.\nTo complete an assessment at this stage, the design must be advanced to a point where the relevant design \ninformation is available to enable the BREEAM Assessor to evaluate and verify the building\u2019s performance against \nthe criteria defined in this scheme document. The interim DS assessment will therefore be completed and certified at \nthe scheme design or detailed design stages.\nPost-construction stage (PCS)\nThe post-construction stage (PCS) assessment and BREEAM rating confirms the final as-built performance of the \nbuilding at the new construction stage of the life cycle. A final PCS assessment is completed and certified after \npractical completion of the building works.\nThere are two approaches to assessment at the post-construction stage:\n\u00a01. A post-construction review (PCR) based on a completed interim design stage assessment\n\u00a02.

These weightings are then set as appropriate for that project \nand all other projects thereafter in that country or region for the life of the current BREEAM International New \nConstruction version. The development of these weightings is based on robust and independent information \nforwarded from 'local experts' who have an understanding of local conditions. This may be a member of the design \nteam if they can demonstrate sufficient knowledge of the environmental conditions of the region or country, or \nanother individual or organisation with the relevant expertise.\nThe required information is compiled by the BREEAM Assessor using the 'BREEAM International Weightings' form \n(available from BREEAM Projects). It is the assessor's responsibility to correctly complete the 'Environmental \nWeightings' and submit the form to BRE Global, who use the information to develop appropriate weightings for \nthat country or region.\nThe weightings are tailored based on the 10 technical categories, with categories being considered 'Fixed' or \n'Variable'. Fixed categories are those defined as having a universal impact, independent of the local context. Variable \ncategories are those defined as being variable locally, due to social, environmental, political or economic factors. BRE \nGlobal will take account of these factors when determining the relative importance of the technical sections.\nThe influence of location\nAs well as having an impact on the weightings attributed to BREEAM sections and assessment issues (see \nAdaptation of weightings for local conditions above), the culture, economy, climate and work practices can also \naffect the development of criteria and the method of assessing certain BREEAM issues.\nOne example involves the opportunity for rainwater recycling in the BREEAM issue Wat 01 Water consumption on \npage\u00a0253. In this instance the higher performance benchmarks vary according to the amount of precipitation \navailable. The assessor can determine the precipitation zone in which the building is located using the map in Figure \n4 on the next page (and other information below) and consequently use this climatic zone to establish the \nappropriate water consumption benchmark for a building in that location.\nThe map below highlights the Earth's climatic zones according to the K\u00f6ppen-Geiger climate classification method. \nThey are defined according to maximum and minimum temperature ranges, as well as the total and seasonal \ndistribution of precipitation.\nFor the purposes of BREEAM, the climatic zones (refer to Figure 3 on the next page) are defined as:\n\u00a0A. Equatorial - tropical climates where temperatures remain above 18\u00b0C\n\u00a0B. Arid - dry climates (semi-arid and desert climates)\n\u00a0C. Warm temperate - mid-latitude climates (warm, dry summers with cool, wet winters)\n\u00a0D. Snow - temperate, is generally between -3\u00b0C and 10\u00b0C (subarctic or temperate alpine areas and low \nprecipitation)\n\u00a0E. Polar - permafrost or tundra climates.\nFor the purposes of Wat 01 Water consumption on page\u00a0253, the precipitation zones (refer to Figure 4 on the next \npage) are defined as:\n\u00a01. Precipitation zone 1: corresponds to K\u00f6ppen\u2019s precipitation regions f (fully humid) and m (monsoonal)\n\u00a02. Precipitation zone 2: corresponds to K\u00f6ppen\u2019s precipitation regions s (summer dry) and w (winter dry)\n\u00a03.

Each issue addresses a specific \nbuilding related environmental impact or issue and has a number of credits assigned to it.\nBREEAM credits are awarded where a building demonstrates that it meets the best practice performance levels \ndefined for that issue, i.e. it has mitigated an impact or, in the case of Health and wellbeing on page\u00a081, addressed a \nspecific building occupant-related issue, e.g. good thermal comfort, daylight or acoustics.\nThe number of credits available for an individual assessment issue will vary and generally the higher the number \nthere are for a given issue, the more important that issue is in terms of mitigating its impact. In most cases, where \nthere are multiple credits available, the number awarded is based on a sliding scale or benchmark, where \nprogressively higher standards of building performance are rewarded with a higher number of credits.\nIt is worth noting that, in addition to the environmental sections, and overall score and BREEAM rating, verified \nperformance against individual assessment issues also provides users with a credible set of key building performance \nindicators for a range of embodied, operational and construction phase building impacts. In this respect, in addition \nto using BREEAM to define overall targets, it is possible to use the method to define performance levels in support \nof specific organisational policy objectives for individual environmental issues. Care should be taken when setting \ndesign targets using individual issues and credit levels in this way as it can limit design flexibility and have an impact \non project costs.\nAwarding credits for innovation\nIt is one of the aims of BREEAM to support innovation within the construction industry and its supply chain. \nBREEAM does this by making additional credits available for the recognition of sustainability related benefits or \nperformance levels which are currently not recognised by standard BREEAM assessment issues and criteria. By doing \nthis BREEAM is rewarding buildings that go beyond best practice in terms of a particular aspect of sustainability, i.e. \nwhere the building or its procurement has demonstrated innovation.\nAwarding credits for innovation enables clients and design teams to boost their building\u2019s BREEAM performance \nand, in addition, helps to support the market for new innovative technologies, and design or construction practices.\nThere are two ways in which BREEAM awards \u2018innovation credits\u2019 to recognise innovation in building design and \nprocurement. The first is by meeting exemplary performance criteria defined within an existing BREEAM issue, i.e. \ngoing beyond the standard BREEAM assessment criteria and therefore best practice. Note, not all assessment issues \nhave exemplary performance criteria. The second route is where an application is made to BRE Global by the \nregistered project\u2019s BREEAM Assessor to have a particular building technology or feature, design or construction \nmethod or process recognised as \u2018innovative\u2019. If the application is successful and subsequently compliance is verified, \nan \u2018innovation credit\u2019 can be awarded.\nAn additional 1% can be added to a building\u2019s overall score for each \u2018innovation credit\u2019 achieved. The maximum \nnumber of \u2019innovation credits\u2019 that can be awarded for any one building is 10; therefore the maximum available \nadditional score for \u2018innovation\u2019 is 10%. The building's final BREEAM score will be capped at 100%. Innovation \ncredits can be awarded regardless of the building\u2019s final BREEAM rating, i.e. they can be awarded at any BREEAM \nrating level. Refer to Inn 01 Innovation on page\u00a0402 for more detail.\nTechnical Manual \u2013 Version 6.0.0 \u2013 01/12/2021 \u2013 SD250\n35\n"

In some \ncountries there may be local equivalents of these standards and in these cases BREEAM International allows BRE \nGlobal staff, with support from assessors and the project team, to review the local standards against BREEAM \nspecified requirements and confirm their equivalence. The assessors need to send in the local standards to BRE \nGlobal for approval. Ideally the relevant sections of the standards will be translated into English; however, BRE \nGlobal can also provide this service for a fee.\nIf BRE Global approves the standard as equivalent, the local standard will form part of the approved standards for \nthat country, region or area.\nApproved standards and weightings list\nThe individual requirements for a particular local standard and a list of approved standards are provided in the \napproved standards and weightings list (ASWL).\nEvery BREEAM International assessment must include a version of the approved standards and weightings list when \nan assessment is submitted to inform BRE Global which standards the project team have worked to and complied \nwith. This may involve the use of a 'New country worksheet' or, where assessments have already been undertaken in \nthat country, an 'Existing country-specific worksheet' that is amended to suit the specific project.\nFor each BREEAM criterion requiring compliance with specified standards or best practice documents a combination \nof the following three situations is likely, as circumstances vary between issues.\n\u00a01. No specific local standard is specified - when submitting the assessment the project team uses the approved \nstandards and weightings list to inform BRE Global that it will be working to the requirements detailed in the \ncriteria or the default International Standard.\n\u00a02. Approved local standard is specified - when submitting the assessment the project team uses the approved \nstandards and weightings list to inform BRE Global that it will be using the approved local standards detailed \nin the 'Existing country-specific worksheet'. The team also need to confirm that the standards being used are \ncurrent.\n\u00a03. Unapproved local standard is proposed - at the earliest opportunity the project team uses the approved \nstandards and weightings list to inform BRE Global that they will be working to (as yet unapproved) local \nstandards. The team will need to send the relevant sections of the standard to BRE Global with evidence of its \nrobustness.\nNote: The approvals process for local standards happens at the very early stages of a project assessment, i.e. \nwell before a report is submitted for certification so that:\n\u00a0a. Certification is not delayed, and\n\u00a0b.

If not, \nit is added to the 'rejected standards' for that country - this is included for information and to prevent duplication of \neffort.\nMore details on this process can be found within the BREEAM Operations Manual (SD5070), available on BREEAM \nProjects.\n36\nTechnical Manual \u2013 Version 6.0.0 \u2013 01/12/2021 \u2013 SD250\n"

            "content": "Evidence\nThe BREEAM evidential requirements\nThis section provides guidance to assessors and project teams on the types of evidence required to demonstrate \ncompliance with BREEAM issues.\nWhy does BREEAM require evidence?\nBREEAM is a third party assessment and certification scheme operated in accordance with international standards. \nOperating to international standards ensures that certification schemes such as BREEAM are run in a consistent and \nreliable manner. The BREEAM Assessor's assessment report and the BRE Global quality assurance process are the \nfundamental tenets of BREEAM, ensuring consistency of, and confidence in, the BREEAM rating awarded by the \nassessor.\nTo maintain this consistency and credibility, all certification decisions must be based on verified and credible project \ninformation that is traceable, i.e. evidence based. This is not only important for ensuring compliance with the \ninternational standards to which BREEAM operates, but also in terms of managing risk to clients and BREEAM \nAssessors in the event that a certification outcome is challenged.\nThe assessment report and the BREEAM Assessor role\nIt is the BREEAM Assessor who determines the BREEAM rating and the assessment report is the formal record of an \nassessor's audit against the criteria defined in the Technical Manual for a BREEAM scheme. The BREEAM certificate \nissued by BRE Global provides assurance that the service provided by the assessor (that is, the process of producing \nthe assessment report) has been conducted in accordance with the requirements of the scheme. The purpose of the \ncertificate is therefore to give confidence to the client in the assessor's performance and processes in determining a \nBREEAM rating.\nIt is the role of the assessor to gather project information and use it to assess performance against the BREEAM \nscheme in a competent and impartial manner. To award a BREEAM credit, the assessor must be satisfied beyond \nreasonable doubt that the evidence gathered demonstrates unambiguous compliance with all relevant criteria \ndefined in the BREEAM scheme. All evidence must be appropriately referenced in the formal report produced by the \nassessor and made available on request from BRE Global for quality assurance checks.\nClear, ordered and well referenced evidence for each BREEAM issue and criterion facilitates efficient quality \nassurance and certification. BREEAM Assessors can access further guidance on assessment report referencing in \nAssessor Guidance Note 01, and the 'reporting process' webinar, both available from the BREEAM Assessor \nGuidance section of BREEAM Projects (www.breeam.com/projects).\nEvidence \nEvidence should not necessarily need to be prepared specifically for the purpose of the BREEAM assessment. In many \ninstances, the assessor should be able to source readily available and prepared project information for the purpose \nof demonstrating compliance. For this reason, BREEAM aims to avoid being prescriptive on the type of evidence \nrequired, while each issue does have specific documents listed these are provided as guidance rather than a definite \nlist.\nThe assessor and project team will find that many assessment issues require more than one piece or type of \ninformation to demonstrate compliance with one criterion, or alternatively, one piece of information may be \nsufficient to demonstrate compliance with multiple criteria.\nTechnical Manual \u2013 Version 6.0.0 \u2013 01/12/2021 \u2013 SD250\n39\n"

Such evidence \nmust also make clear the actions and evidence (or an understanding thereof) that will be undertaken and provided \nto ensure the project's ongoing compliance, particularly at the final stage of assessment, i.e. post-construction. This \nis to ensure that the party who makes the commitment is clearly aware of the actions and evidence that needs to be \nsupplied to demonstrate compliance with BREEAM at the final stage of assessment. For example, in many \ncircumstances it would not be acceptable for the design team to copy and paste the BREEAM criteria into a formal \ncommitment. The commitment should specifically detail how criteria are to be achieved in the context of the \nassessment, and often copying and pasting the BREEAM criteria will not provide this level of detail.\nWhile letters of commitment can play a role in demonstrating compliance, they are not a replacement for more \nformal and established types of project information. The assessor must not award credits where they have a reason \nto doubt the validity or intent of written commitments, or where it is not unreasonable to expect formal design or \nspecification information to be available to confirm compliance.\nWritten commitments at the final stage of assessment \u2013 Post-\nconstruction\nAs stated in the Scope section, there are two types of assessment that can be carried out at the post-construction \nstage, a post-construction review of a design stage assessment, or a post-construction assessment (where no design \nstage assessment has been carried out). The 'Final post-construction stage' column of the evidence table in each \nissue assumes that a design stage assessment has been completed. Where a design stage assessment has not been \ncompleted, the assessor will need to review both the 'Interim design stage' and 'Final post-construction stage' \nevidence listed in the evidence table and ensure sufficient evidence is submitted with the assessment to demonstrate \ncompliance with the criteria.\nEvidence supplied at the post-construction stage must be reflective of the completed building and must therefore \ndemonstrate what has actually been implemented. For example, if sub-meters have been specified at the design \nstage, evidence at the post-construction stage would need to demonstrate that these have actually been installed. \nAppropriate evidence may be a site inspection report with supporting photographs or as-built drawings showing \nthe location of the sub-meters.\nLetters of commitment cannot be used to demonstrate compliance at the final, post-construction stage of \nassessment. The only exception to this is where the criteria require an action to take place post-construction, i.e. after \nhandover and possibly during the building operation. An example could be a written commitment from the building \nowner or occupier making a commitment to conduct post-occupancy evaluation. As with written commitments at \nthe design stage, the BREEAM Assessor must not award BREEAM credits where they have a reason to doubt the \nvalidity or intent of written commitments or where it is not unreasonable to expect formal documentation, e.g. a \nschedule of services or professional services contract.\nEvidence principles that BREEAM Assessors and BRE Global Quality \nAssurance work to\nAs described above, where specific evidence is stated in the 'Evidence' table within each assessment issue, this must \nbe sourced and verified by the BREEAM Assessor.\n40\nTechnical Manual \u2013 Version 6.0.0 \u2013 01/12/2021 \u2013 SD250\n"

Below is \na list of the minimum information the assessor must expect to see when certain types of evidence are submitted.\nCommunication records: Any communication records used as evidence must provide clear confirmation of the site \nname, author's identity and role, the date and recipient's identity.\nFormal letters of correspondence: Must be on company or organisation headed note-paper with a signature \n(electronic signatures are acceptable). Ideally letters should be a secured document. (Please see sections relating to \nwritten commitment for further information.)\nMeeting minutes: Must include date, location and attendee information (names, organisations and roles), along \nwith a record of the meeting and agreed actions.\nDrawings: All drawings must have the building or site name, phase (if applicable), title of drawing, date, revision \nnumber and a scale.\nSpecification: A specification must be clear that it relates to the project under assessment, and it must have a date \nand revision number. Where sections of a specification are provided, the assessor should reference the extract and as \na minimum submit the front page of the specification detailing the project name, revision number and date.\nSite inspection report: A site inspection report must include the building or site name, date, author and summary \ntext to detail what was witnessed, confirming compliance. Photographic evidence can be used to support the text in \nthe report.\nFor other types of evidence not listed, the assessor should use the above as a guide for the sort of evidence that is \nsuitable. As a minimum, in most cases, the evidence used to assess compliance should always contain key \ninformation such as the project name, the author, date, revision numbers etc.\n42\nTechnical Manual \u2013 Version 6.0.0 \u2013 01/12/2021 \u2013 SD250\n"

This is to ensure smooth and successful delivery of the project's \nsustainability objectives. Project delivery stakeholders therefore include the client, the building occupier \n(where known), the design team and the principal contractor. With regards to contractors' involvement, it \nensures their input in terms of formulating sustainable design solutions, commenting on the practicality and \nbuildability of (one or more) design solutions and their impact on programming, costs etc. BREEAM \nrecognises that traditionally for some projects, the contractor for the works might not be appointed at the \nearly stages of the project and therefore compliance with criterion 1 on page\u00a044 would not be possible.

Costs are normally \nat building elemental level on the entire asset. Information may be a mix of typical benchmark costs for key \nelements, comparative cost modelling or approximate estimates. It is expressed as cost per square metre of \ngross internal floor area (GIFA) and presented for elemental analysis, aligned to the level of capital cost plans.\nComponent level LCC options appraisal\n\u00a0\nA component level LCC plan is commonly used for cost planning specification choices of systems or \ncomponent levels during design development. Component level LCC appraisal for service life planning \nrequires the environment of the building and other local conditions to be identified, and the fundamental \nrequirements to be met in planning the service life of the building. Decisions should be made on:\n\u00a0\nThe likely design life of the building (rather than the contractual design life)\nMinimum functional performance criteria for each component over the building's design life\nComponents that must be repairable, maintainable or replaceable within the design life of the \nbuilding. Only the key differentiators between components and systems need to be comparatively \nmodelled.\nCapital cost\n\u00a0\nThe capital cost for the building includes the expenses related to the initial construction of the building: \nConstruction, including preparatory works, materials, equipment and labour\nSite management\nConstruction financing\nInsurance and taxes during construction\nInspection and testing.\nCosts relating to land procurement, clearance, design, statutory approvals and post occupancy aftercare \nshould not be included. \nOther information\nCapital cost reporting\nThe lack of data relating to capital and life cycle costs and benefits arising from more sustainable building design \npresents a major barrier to take-up of more sustainable solutions. This issue seeks to encourage the sharing of data \nto break down these barriers and ensure that BREEAM continues to encourage cost effective and financially \nbeneficial solutions. This information is collected to assist research into the cost and savings of developing \nsustainable or BREEAM-assessed buildings. This is used to inform the business case for sustainability and the \nongoing development of BREEAM. All data submitted will be treated as confidential and will only be used \nanonymously.\nWhen to undertake life cycle costing\nLife cycle costing is relevant throughout the building or constructed asset's life cycle, in particular during the project \nplanning, design and construction and also during the in-use phases. (For further information please refer to ISO \n15686-5.)\nStandardised method for life cycle costing (SMLCC) for construction\nISO 15686-5:2008 describes the standardised method for life cycle costing (SMLCC) for construction procurement. \nThe objectives of this guide are to provide the following.\n54\nTechnical Manual \u2013 Version 6.0.0 \u2013 01/12/2021 \u2013 SD250\n"

If the POE is to be carried out by an organisation involved with the design of the building, e.g. the project \narchitect, they must present the assessor with the evidence that demonstrates the independence of the \nPOE process from the design process. BREEAM has not attempted to define what form this exercise must \ntake; the onus is on the design team or relevant individual to clearly demonstrate to the BREEAM \nAssessor a credible level of independence.\nActual vs predicted performance\n\u00a0\nIn most cases it is not feasible to accurately compare predicted vs actual performance due to variances in the \nassumptions used in the models. Figures reported via the UK's Carbon Buzz website show that on average, \nbuildings consume between 1.5 and 2.5 times the predicted values. When comparing predicted with actual \nvalues, an analysis should be carried out to understand why there may be discrepancies in performance. \nThese discrepancies can be for a number of reasons including: \nPredicted energy consumption is normally based upon building regulation compliance models \nwhich only focus on 'regulated' energy use. Additional unrelated energy use may not have been \nmodelled in the design prediction model\nThey may be extended use due to extra occupancy and operating hours, not accounted for in the \npredicted models\nInefficiencies from poor control, bad commissioning or poor maintenance\nAdditional special functions such as a cafeteria, server rooms etc. not accounted for in the predicted \nmodel\nVariances in actual occupant behaviour that vary from predicted, such as use of small power and \nlighting.\nCIBSE TM54, Evaluating Operational Energy Performance of Buildings at the Design Stage, CIBSE, 2013 \nprovides guidance on how to improve the accuracy of the model for operational energy use of buildings at \nthe design stage. The Carbon Trust guidance, 'Closing the gap: Lessons learned on realising the potential of \nlow carbon building design', also provides additional guidance on this issue.\nAbsence of predicted performance data\n\u00a0\nWhere building occupiers do not have predicted performance models, it may be more appropriate to \nbenchmark actual building performance data with other sources of Building Performance Evaluation Data \nand benchmarks. The following sources of benchmarking information are from the UK and are \ninternationally recognised. Building performance benchmarks can be found in CIBSE Guidance including: \nGuide F: Energy Efficiency in Buildings\nCIBSE TM46: Energy Benchmarks\nCIBSE TM47: Operational Ratings and Display Energy Certificates.\nAdditional information of building performance and benchmarking can be found at Buildings Performance \nInstitute Europe (BPIE) (www.bpie.eu) and ASHRAE (www.ashrae.org).\nPOE Methodologies\n\u00a0\nThe most relevant POE methodology that fulfils the criteria should be used. For example, in the UK, the \nbuilding use studies (BUS) methodology was developed following a series of Government funded 'PROBE' \nbuilding performance evaluation studies in 1995. The BUS methodology is used by independent licensed \npartners following a four part process. Further information can be found at: www.busmethodology.org.uk.\n\u00a0\nBRE's Design Quality Method (DQM) is a tried and tested, independent, POE method used by all UK auditing \nauthorities, and many funding bodies.

If for example, a \ndevelopment has six rooms that must be assessed, each 150m\u00b2 (total area \n900m\u00b2) and 80% of this floor area must meet the criterion, then 720m\u00b2 must \ncomply with the criterion; this is equal to 4.8 rooms. The number of rooms \nthat must comply must always be rounded up; therefore in this example, five \nrooms must have an average daylight factor of 2% or more (plus meet the \nother criteria) to achieve the credit.\nCN3.3\nExternal \nobstructions\nIn calculating minimum and average daylight factors and daylight \nilluminances, external obstructions should be taken into account. For \nilluminance calculations, the reflectance of external obstructions should be \ntaken as 0.2 unless on  site measurements of external reflectance have been \nmade.\nCN3.4\nDirt factors when \ncalculating \ndaylight\nDaylight calculations should include a maintenance factor for dirt on the \nwindows.  An example is given in  British Standard Code of Practice for \ndaylighting, BS 8206 Part 2, appendix A1.3.\nCN3.5\nBorrowed light\nFor areas where borrowed light is used to demonstrate compliance with \ndaylighting criteria, calculations or results from appropriate lighting design \nsoftware must be provided to demonstrate that such areas meet the BREEAM \ncriteria (if the light from these sources is required in order for the room to \ncomply). Examples of borrowed light include: light shelves, clerestory glazing, \nsun pipes or internal translucent or transparent partitions (such as those \nusing frosted glass).\nCN3.6\nRoom depth \ncriterion - rooms lit \nfrom two opposite \nsides\nFor rooms lit by windows on two opposite sides, the maximum room depth \nthat can be satisfactorily illuminated by daylight is twice the limiting room \ndepth (d) (measured from window wall to window wall; CIBSE Lighting Guide \nLG108. The reflectance of the imaginary internal wall should be taken as 1.\nCN3.7\nUniformity with \nrooflights\nThe room depth criteria cannot be used where the lighting strategy relies on \nrooflights. In such areas either appropriate software has to be used to \ncalculate the uniformity ratio or, in the case of a regular array of rooflights \nacross the whole of the space, figure 2.36 (page  37) within CIBSE Lighting \nGuide LG10 can be used to determine the uniformity ratio.\nCN3.8\nDaylighting - \nuniformity ratio \ncalculation\nThe uniformity ratio calculation, minimum point daylight factor and \nminimum daylight illuminance can exclude areas within 0.5m  of walls.

Please note there is a specific, unrelated, definition of 'unoccupied' with reference to acoustic \ntesting and measurement and this should not be confused with the definition used here.\nPoint daylight factor\n\u00a0\nA point daylight factor is the ratio between the illuminance (from daylight) at a specific point on the working \nplane within a room, expressed as a percentage of the illuminance received on an outdoor unobstructed \nhorizontal plane. This is based on an assumed overcast sky, approximated by the 'CIE (Commission \nInternationale de l'Eclairage) overcast sky'. The minimum point daylight factor is the lowest value of the \ndaylight factor on the working plane at a point that is not within 0.5m of a wall. Similarly the minimum \nilluminance is calculated at the worst lit point on the working plane that is not within 0.5m of a wall. These \npoints will usually be close to a rear corner of the room.

The following are methods deemed to satisfy this criterion dependent upon the \ncomplexity of the proposed system: \n18.a.i\nThe openable window area in each occupied space is equivalent to 5% of the gross internal \nfloor area of that room or floor plate. For room or floor plates between 7m-15m depth, the \nopenable window area must be on opposite sides and evenly distributed across the area to \npromote adequate cross-ventilation; OR\n18.a.ii\nThe design demonstrates that the natural ventilation strategy provides an adequate cross flow \nof air to maintain the required thermal comfort conditions and ventilation rates.\nFor a strategy which does not rely on openable windows, or which has occupied spaces with a plan \ndepth greater than 15m, the design must demonstrate that the ventilation strategy can provide \nadequate cross flow of air to maintain the required thermal comfort conditions and ventilation rates.\n19\nThe natural ventilation strategy is capable of providing at least two levels of user control on the supply of fresh \nair to the occupied space (see CN3.12 on page\u00a0108 for further details).\nNote: Any opening mechanisms must be easily accessible and provide adequate user control over air flow \nrates to avoid draughts.

It is not the glazed \narea of a fa\u00e7ade or the glazed area of the part of the window that is openable (unless it opens fully).\nSources of external pollution\n\u00a0\nThis includes, but is not limited to the following: \n\u00a01. Highways and the main access roads on the assessed site\n\u00a02. Car parks, delivery areas and vehicle waiting bays\n\u00a03. Other building exhausts, including from building services plant, industrial or agricultural processes.\n Service and access roads with restricted and infrequent access (for example roads used only for waste \ncollection) are unlikely to represent a significant source of external pollution. These roads can therefore be \nexcluded from the criteria of this issue. This does not include vehicle pick-up or drop-off or waiting bays.\nTotal semi-volatile organic compound (TSVOC)\n\u00a0\nSum of the concentrations of identified and unidentified volatile organic compounds eluting between n-\nhexadecane (excluded) and n-docosane (included) on a gas chromatographic column.\nTotal volatile organic compound (TVOC)\n\u00a0\nSum of the concentrations of identified and unidentified volatile organic compounds eluting between and \nincluding n-hexane and n-hexadecane on a gas chromatographic column.\nOther information\nPost-construction indoor air quality measurement\nThe measurement of formaldehyde and TVOC must be made in accordance with the relevant standards (as listed in \nthe criteria). ISO 16000-242 and ISO 16000-5 provide guidance on sampling strategies for formaldehyde and VOCs, \nrespectively. Sampling should be performed in rooms that will be occupied for long periods of time such as \nbedrooms, living rooms, classrooms, offices, etc. A representative number of rooms should be sampled, rather than \nevery room in the building. For example, in an office building, sampling of one cellular or single occupancy office \nshould suffice to assess the indoor air quality for that type of habitable space in the building (assuming the other \ncellular offices have the same materials specification and ventilation strategy). In larger rooms, such as open-plan \noffice areas, additional sampling locations may be required in order to understand the homogeneity of the indoor \nenvironment. \nUncertainties in sampling and analysis are inevitable and unavoidable, therefore it is recommended that replicate \nsamples are taken at each sampling location (ideally a minimum of three samples for each measurement parameter). \nBefore sampling, naturally ventilated rooms should be intensively ventilated for 15 minutes and then outer doors \nand windows closed for at least 8 hours (e.g. overnight) before sampling begins with the room still closed off. For \nmechanically ventilated rooms, the ventilation system should be running under standard operating conditions for at \nleast for 3 hours before sampling begins. Sampling locations should be at least 1m to 2m from a wall and at a \nheight of between 1m to 1.5m.\nThis information is provided to assist project teams and BREEAM Assessors on the appropriate scope of post-\nconstruction indoor air quality measurement, and, as such, is intended as guidance only and not a compliance \nrequirement. The sampling strategy should be determined based on the advice of the appropriate person appointed \nto conduct the testing.\n110\nTechnical Manual \u2013 Version 6.0.0 \u2013 01/12/2021 \u2013 SD250\n"

Industry standard weather data \nshould be sought from an appropriate local or national best practice standard in the form of Test Reference \nYears (TRYs) and Design Summer Years (DSYs). \n\u00a0\nThe weather data enables thermal analysis of building designs under current climatic conditions, yet no \naccount is normally taken of the projected variations in weather data that will occur during the building's life \ncycle as a result of climate change. To demonstrate compliance, weather data should be used based upon a \nprojected climate change scenario. The following probabilistic DSY weather data files should be used to \nestablish the projected climate change environment against which the design is evaluated:\n118\nTechnical Manual \u2013 Version 6.0.0 \u2013 01/12/2021 \u2013 SD250\n"

Where design teams feel that added \nconsideration of building occupant risk or sensitivity to overheating is necessary, weather files can be used \nthat exceed the minimum requirements outlined above. The time periods indicated above have been selected \nto represent the building services life cycle likely to be present in each building services strategy type. A \nshorter time period is chosen for mechanically ventilated or mixed-mode building types due to consideration \nof mechanical servicing equipment life span (before major upgrade or replacement is required), and to avoid \nover-specification of plant which could lead to inefficient operation. This should be sought from a \nrecognised local or national best practice standard or organisation. Verification should be sought from BRE \nGlobal prior to using any such standards in an assessment.\nSeparate occupant control \n\u00a0\nResponsive heating or cooling controls for a particular area or zone of the building that can be accessed and \noperated by the individuals occupying that area or zone. Such controls will be located within, or within the \nvicinity of, the zone or area they control. \n Thermal comfort \n\u00a0\nIn EN ISO 7730:2005: Ergonomics of the thermal environment. Analytical determination and interpretation \nof thermal comfort, 'thermal comfort' is defined using the calculation of PMV and PPD indices and local \nthermal comfort criteria and is 'that condition of mind which expresses satisfaction with the thermal \nenvironment.' The term 'thermal comfort' describes a person's psychological state of mind and is usually \nreferred to in terms of whether someone is feeling too hot or too cold. Thermal comfort is difficult to define \nbecause it needs to account for a range of environmental and personal factors in order to establish what \nmakes people feel comfortable. The purpose of this issue is to encourage appropriate and robust \nconsideration of thermal comfort issues and specification of appropriate occupant controls to ensure both \nmaximum flexibility of the space and thermal comfort for the majority of building occupants. \n Thermal dynamic analysis\n\u00a0\nThermal comfort analysis tools can be subdivided into a number of methods of increasing complexity. The \nmost complex of these and the one that provides greatest confidence in results, is the full dynamic model. \nThis type of model enables annual heating or cooling loads, overheating risks and control strategies to be \nassessed. \nOther information\nProjected climate change weather data\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 5th Assessment Report outlines future climate change \nscenarios that can be used to project a range of alternative probabilistic weather data. These weather data should be \nused to evaluate the impact of varying climate change scenarios for the country to influence building design \nperformance for the building throughout its life cycle. Projected climate change weather data should be sourced in \nTRYs and DSYs. \nWhile not internationally applicable, reference can be made to the UK PROMETHEUS project at Exeter University that \nproduced a number of future weather files specific to different locations across the UK, created using the UK Climate \nProjection 2009 (UKCP09) weather generator. Weather files produced under the PROMETHEUS project are available \nat the following location:\nemps.exeter.ac.uk/engineering/research/cee/research/prometheus/downloads/\nTechnical Manual \u2013 Version 6.0.0 \u2013 01/12/2021 \u2013 SD250\n119\n"

Where relevant, measurement of impact sound pressure level should be conducted in one in four teaching \nspaces (separated from rooms above) of each room type or performance requirement category and construction \ntype.\n\u00a012. The measured level of ambient noise should be used to determine compliance with the criteria for acoustically \nsensitive rooms. If at the time of acoustic commissioning it is not possible to measure ambient noise levels in \nthe absence of construction or other extraneous noise sources that will not be present when the building is \ncomplete, then, for mechanical services the lower level of 35 dB, LAeq or the lowest design limit for the \nacoustically sensitive space should be used.\nThe above is intended as guidance for undertaking acoustic testing or measurements to demonstrate compliance \nwith the performance requirements in BREEAM. If the acoustician has felt it necessary to deviate from the above \nprocedures, they should provide a reason for doing so and confirm that the alternative procedures are adequate for \ndemonstrating that the building meets the acoustic performance requirements.\nTesting, measurement and calculation procedures; residential buildings and long term stay \nresidential institutions only\nFrequency of testing\nWhen the country does not have legislation regarding frequency of testing, the following guidance below sets out \nthe number of airborne or impact sound insulation tests to be conducted on each group or sub-group.

In the absence of strong low frequency noise, LAeq,T can be estimated from the NR value using \nthe following formula: LAeq,T\u2248 NR + 6 dB. Therefore, if the NR value is known, but not the sound pressure levels in \nthe individual frequency bands, an estimate for the indoor ambient noise level LAeq,T can still be determined from the \nNR value for the building services noise.

In this case, \nenergy services supplying energy-consuming systems from the existing \nbuilding shall, as a minimum, be metered at the entry points to the extension, \ne.g. hot water, chilled water, gas and electricity. However, the best practice \napproach would usually be to ensure that the energy  metering covers the \nentire building.  \nBuilding type specific\nCN4\nBuildings situated \non campus \ndevelopments\nThe systems  for buildings situated on campus developments must be \nmonitored using  either an appropriate energy monitoring and management \nsystem or another  automated control system, e.g. outstations linked to a \ncentral computer.  The criteria only apply to the assessed building. Where \nenergy services are supplied from an existing building on the campus, they \nshall be metered at the entry points to the assessed building, e.g. hot water, \nchilled water, gas and electricity. Provision of a pulsed or other open protocol  \ncommunication  output is not sufficient to award the credit for these building  \ntypes.  \nMethodology\nOverall metering strategy\nThe overall metering strategy should be developed in line with the guidance for new buildings available in CIBSE \nTM39 Building energy metering54.\nAs described in the guidance, energy consumption does not necessarily need to be separately monitored if the cost \nto install the monitoring equipment is expected to exceed the likely benefits and savings achieved.\nSub-metering by end-use\nThe annual energy consumption of each end-use must be estimated and end-uses that collectively account for 90% \nof the total energy consumption (for each fuel or energy supply) must be covered by sub-meters.\nWhere a given end use will clearly account for less than 10% of the total annual energy consumption for the fuel \ntype in question , a simple hand calculation or use of benchmark data to demonstrate this is acceptable.\nWhere it is unclear whether an end use would account for less than 10% of the annual energy consumption for a \ngiven fuel type or not, more detailed calculations should be provided, and energy consumption should be estimated \nbased on actual energy consumption. For example, by using the methods described in CIBSE TM54 Evaluating \noperational energy performance of buildings at the design stage55. This should use actual operational inputs (rather \nthan those used for building regulations calculations) and weather data for the local area.\nThe data on water consumption from Wat 01 Water consumption may be used as inputs for evaluating the energy \nuse of domestic hot water.\nTypical energy end-use categories include:\n\u00a01. Space heating generation\n\u00a02. Space cooling generation\n\u00a03. Hot water generation\n\u00a04.

Typically, in buildings where 40% of the floor area is laboratory related, only \n10% will actually constitute laboratory areas as per the BREEAM definition. Different types of laboratories \nhave different requirements for HVAC, plug load for small power equipment and access. This can lead to \nenormous variations in energy and water requirements. The main types of laboratories include.\n\u00a01. Wet laboratories - where chemicals, drugs or other material or biological matter are tested and analysed \nrequiring water, direct ventilation and specialised piped utilities. They typically include chemical science \nlaboratories. These laboratories require specially designed facilities.\n\u00a02. Dry laboratories - contain dry stored materials, electronics, or large instruments with few piped services. \nThey typically include engineering or analytical laboratories that may require accurate temperature and \nhumidity control, dust control, and clean power.\n\u00a03. Microbiological and clinical laboratories - often involve working with infectious agents. They typically \nrequire higher levels of primary containment and multiple secondary barriers including specialised \nventilation systems to ensure directional air flow, air treatment systems to decontaminate or remove \nagents from exhaust air, controlled access zones, airlocks as laboratory entrances, or separate buildings or \nmodules to isolate the laboratory.\n\u00a04. In vivo laboratories - these require highly controlled environments for the care and maintenance of flora \nand fauna. The facilities are complex, and expensive to build and to operate. Tight environmental control \nover the facility is required to avoid the introduction of contaminants or pathogens, and prevent the \npossibility of infectious outbreaks, and avoid the transmission of odours.\n\u00a05. Teaching laboratories - unique to academic institutes, they require space for teaching equipment, storage \nspace for student belongings and less instrumentation than research labs.\n\u00a06. Clean rooms - refers to a controlled environment (air quality, temperature and humidity) which prevent \ncontamination and require the regulating of environmental conditions, to facilitate accurate research and \nproduction needs. They are typically used in universities for nanotechnology, medical and pharmaceutical \nresearch or studies and microelectronics applications.\nRight-sizing\n\u00a0\nRight-sizing principles encourage the use of better estimates in equipment loads from which services \nequipment is sized in comparison to traditional methods of estimates based on rated data obtained from \nmanufacturers' literature or design assumptions from previous projects. This can result in construction cost \nsavings in addition to life cycle cost benefits, while taking account of the need for appropriate contingency.\nOther information\nSynergy with BREEAM issue \u2013 Reduction of energy use and carbon emissions\nThis BREEAM issue has been developed to recognise improvements made to new laboratory areas or buildings that \nare not currently fully recognised in the National Calculation Methodology, used to assess and award credits in Ene \n01 Reduction of energy use and carbon emissions on page\u00a0150.\nTechnical Manual \u2013 Version 6.0.0 \u2013 01/12/2021 \u2013 SD250\n203\n"

This \nis calculated by determining the number of stopping services at the node during the peak arrival or departure times \nfor the building or the building's typical day's operating hours (see definition 'operating hours'), divided by the \nnumber of hours within that period. For example: the average number of services for an assessment of a building \nthat operates between 08:00 - 19:00 hrs (11 hours) and is within proximity of a bus stop with 35 stopping services \nduring this period is 3.2 (equivalent to an average service frequency of approximately 20 minutes).\nMultiple services\nServices that operate from more than one node within proximity of the building, i.e. two separate bus stops served \nby the same bus, must be considered only once; at the node in closest proximity to the building. Different services at \nthe same node can be considered as separate.\nBidirectional routes\nRoutes will be bidirectional; however for the purpose of calculating the index, consider only the direction with the \nhighest frequency.\nEvidence\nCriteria\nInterim design stage\nFinal post-construction stage\n1, 2\nScale map highlighting the location of the \nbuilding and all public transport nodes in \nproximity of the building.\nTimetables for each service at each public \ntransport node considered.\nThe calculated Accessibility Index below \nfor the building.

For example, a \nbuilding that has a single public transport node 500m from its main building entrance with one service \nstopping every 15 minutes, i.e. four services per hour on average, will score an AI of approximately 1.90. \n218\nTechnical Manual \u2013 Version 6.0.0 \u2013 01/12/2021 \u2013 SD250\n"

The \nservice stopping at each node must provide transport from, or onward travel to, either an urban centre, \nmajor transport node or a community focal point, e.g. doctor's surgery, library, school or village centre. Only \nlocal services should be assessed and any national public transport services should be excluded from the \nanalysis, unless such a service can be said to provide a local commuter service. \nMain building entrance\n\u00a0\nThe main building entrance is the entrance to the assessed building which is directly connected to the main \nbuilding reception, circulation routes, lifts or stairs and is available to the majority of the building's staff and \nvisitors on arrival. It is not the site entrance (unless the site entrance is also the building entrance, e.g. \nbuilding with a boundary on a public highway).\nOperating hours\n\u00a0\nBREEAM seeks to define the building's accessibility to the public transport network for the period during \nwhich the majority of building users will travel to and from the building. In most cases the normal operating \nhours of the building can be used. Where shift patterns see the majority of building users (over 80%) \narriving or leaving during a certain period, for example an office building where the majority of office \nworkers arrive between 8.00-10.00, then that period can be used as an alternative to the operating hours of \nthe building. This accounts for some building types that operate a 24-hour day and on a shift work basis. \nDuring what typically would be deemed unsociable hours, and therefore periods where there is little if any \npublic transport operating, such periods are not required to be accounted for in the assessment of this issue. \nWhere the assessed building operates on a 24-hour basis or the operating hours are unknown at the time of \nassessment, then refer to and use the table of default operating hours, which can be found in the additional \ninformation section of this issue.\nTechnical Manual \u2013 Version 6.0.0 \u2013 01/12/2021 \u2013 SD250\n219\n"

The programme is implemented by the municipality or through a \npublic\u2013private partnership\n\u00a02. The system must be open to casual users who wish to use them for one-\nway rides to work, education or shopping centres\n\u00a03.

For buildings with more than 400 users, the unit of measure can be increased by a ratio of 2.5.\nThe calculation starts from the first 200 building users, with no ratio, and keeps going considering the ratio only for \nthe remaining building users.\nFor example, an office building with 800 users would be required to provide the following number of cycle storage \nspaces:\n1\u2013200 users @ 1 space per 10 users = 20 spaces PLUS\n201\u2013300 users @ 1 space per 15 users (standard unit of measure x 1.5) = 7 spaces PLUS\n301\u2013400 users @ 1 space per 20 users (standard unit of measure x 2) = 5 spaces PLUS\n401+ users @ 1 space per 25 users (standard unit of measure x 2.5) = 16 spaces \nTotal compliant cycle storage spaces required = 48 spaces.\nThe sliding scale of compliance does not apply to the following building types: small and large retail, primary \nschools, and residential institutions.\nMinimum cycle storage provision\nWhere the calculated number of required cycle storage spaces is less than four, total provision should be based on \nthe lower of the following: \n\u00a01.

The alternative Wat 01 method (see Methodology below) should be used \nfor the assessment of a hotel.\nMethodology\nA building's water efficient performance is determined using the BREEAM Wat 01 calculator in one of two ways, \nusing either the standard approach (common building types) or alternative (other building type) approach. Each \napproach is summarised below.\nStandard Wat 01 method \nThe standard BREEAM method determines water efficiency (measured in L/person/day and m\u00b3/person/yr) for a \nbuilding based on the building's actual component specification and default usage patterns for the building type \nand its activity areas. This modelled output is compared with the same output for a baseline component \nspecification and the percentage improvement used to determine the number of BREEAM credits achieved.\nThe baseline component specification is equivalent to the water efficiency of industry standard components (see \nTable 41 on page\u00a0258), steered by the minimum levels required by the Water Supply (Water Fittings) Regulations. \nThe BREEAM percentage improvement benchmarks have then been determined based on progressively more \nefficient standards for water-consuming components and, for the higher levels of performance, the specification of \ngreywater and rainwater systems.\nThe standard approach is the default method for calculating water efficiency of a BREEAM-assessed building and is \nthat used for most of the common building types, where usage data are available. For buildings types where usage \ndata are not available, and therefore the standard approach for determining performance cannot be used, an \nalternative approach to compliance must be used (described below). Refer to the BREEAM Wat 01 calculator for the \ncurrent list of building types which can be assessed using the standard approach.\nAlternative Wat 01 method \nWhere it is not possible to use the standard approach to determine the building's water consumption total \n(L/person/day) the assessment can be completed on an elemental basis, as follows.\n\u00a01. Using the list of applicable domestic-scale water-consuming components (see criterion 3 on page\u00a0253), \ndetermine those that are specified or present in the assessed building.\n\u00a02. Compare the actual specification for each component type with the table of water efficient consumption levels \nby component type (Table 41 on page\u00a0258) to determine the level of performance for each type. Note that the \nvolumes quoted are maximums for that level and the % WC or urinal flushing demand is a minimum for that \nlevel.\n256\nTechnical Manual \u2013 Version 6.0.0 \u2013 01/12/2021 \u2013 SD250\n"

Define each component's level of performance in the 'Other building type calculator' worksheet of the BREEAM \nWat 01 calculator.\n\u00a0a. For the alternative approach, the calculator applies a building type specific weighting to each component \nlevel to reflect its 'in-use' consumption relative to the other components present. A component with high \n'in-use' water consumption therefore has a larger weighting than one with lower 'in-use' consumption and \ncontributes relatively more to the building's overall level of performance under this BREEAM issue.\n\u00a0b. The weightings are derived from data on actual water consumption per day from non-domestic buildings, \nsourced from BNWAT2260. They can be found in the BREEAM Wat 01 calculator.\n\u00a04. Based upon the performance categorisation of each component type and the component weighting, the \ncalculator will determine an overall level of performance and award the relevant number of BREEAM credits as \nfollows:\nGreywater or rainwater level achieved\nPrecipitation zones 1 and 2\nPrecipitation zone 3\nOverall component level\n_\n4\n5\n5\nBaseline\n0 credits\n1 credit\n2 credits\n1 credit\nLevel 1\n1 credit\n2 credits\n3 credits\n2 credits\nLevel 2\n2 credits\n3 credits\n4 credits\n3 credits\nLevel 3 or 4\n3 credits\n4 credits\n5 credits\n4 credits\nLevel 5\n4 credits\n5 credits\n5 credits\n5 credits\nNote:\n\u00a01. An innovation credit for exemplary level performance can be awarded where the component \nspecification achieves level 5 and > 95% of WC or urinal flushing demand is met using recycled \nnon-potable water.\n\u00a02. Due to the use of the weightings, the overall component level achieved will not necessarily be a \nwhole number, e.g. component level 4. Where this is the case the methodology will always \nround down to the nearest component level and therefore BREEAM credits level, e.g. if the \ncomponent specification achieved is 3.6 credits, the actual number of credits awarded is 3 \ncredits (the methodology will not round up to 4 credits because the performance specification \nfor 4 credits has not been achieved).\n\u00a03. Where the assessed building development has multiple specifications for the same water-\nconsuming component type, the number of fittings and component level achieved for each \nspecification can be entered in the 'Other building type calculator'. Using this information, the \ncalculator will determine the building's aggregated performance level for that component type.\nPlease note: while attempts have been made to align the benchmarking of both methodologies described above, \nthey determine performance in different ways. The number of BREEAM credits awarded by each method could \ntherefore differ for the same water component specification. This could lead to variation in the credits achieved \nwhen applying BREEAM New Construction to a number of different building types that form a part of the same \noverall development.\nComponent type\nTable 41 on the next page outlines the standards, by component type, used to define the performance levels set in \nBREEAM.

Therefore no benefit is gained in terms of BREEAM performance, by deciding not \nto specify a particular component. However, the methodology will reflect the reduction in overall water consumption \n(litres/person/day) for the building, as a result of not specifying a particular component.\nBuildings with greywater and rainwater systems\nThe following information is required where a greywater or rainwater system is specified:\nRainwater:\n\u00a01. Collection area (m\u00b2).\n\u00a02. Yield coefficient (a coefficient (%) to recognise that some rainwater is lost due to splashing, evaporation, \nleakage and overflow etc. This coefficient will vary depending on the surface from which the rainwater is \ncollected).\n\u00a03. Hydraulic filter efficiency (a coefficient (%) to recognise the efficiency of the hydraulic filter).\n\u00a04. Rainfall (average mm/year).\nOR\n\u00a05. Daily rainfall collection (litres) calculated in accordance with credible and verifiable national or local data, e.g. a \nregional, national or international meteorological organisation, data source or equivalent.\nGreywater:\n\u00a01. Manufacturer or system designer details.\n\u00a02. The percentage volume of waste water collected (and reused) from the following (where relevant); wash hand \nbasins, showers, kitchen basins, dishwashers, baths, washing machines and sources of waste water from non-\ndomestic components.\nWhere greywater or rainwater systems are specified, a minimum level of component efficiency must be achieved to \naward 4 or 5 BREEAM credits and the exemplary level credit. This is to avoid awarding a higher number of BREEAM \ncredits where performance from less efficient fittings is offset by the specification of a greywater or rainwater \ncollection system.\nThe intention behind this is to ensure demand reduction is prioritised before offsetting consumption. Where a \ngreywater or rainwater system is specified or installed, the component specification must achieve a percentage \nreduction in water consumption (over the baseline specification) equivalent to that required for 2 credits, i.e. a 25% \nimprovement. Where this level is achieved, all of the total water demand met by greywater or rainwater sources can \ncontribute to the overall percentage improvement required to achieve BREEAM credits. If it is not achieved, the \npercentage of greywater or rainwater allowable will be equivalent to the percentage improvement in water \nconsumption achieved for the component specification, i.e. percentage improvement on baseline performance.\nFor example, if a 20% improvement only is achieved, and therefore the building is not meeting the 25% \nrequirement, only 20% of the water demand met via greywater or rainwater sources can be used to offset water \nconsumption from the micro components. This minimum requirement does not apply where only 1, 2 or 3 credits \nare sought or where no greywater or rainwater system is specified, i.e. percentage improvement is based solely on \nthe water efficiency of the micro-component specification.\nBRE Global may allow some exemptions to this rule in instances where a particular fitting type requires a high flow \nrate due to specialised end user requirements, and its specification prevents compliance with 25% improvement.\nBuildings with a mixture of different functional areas\nFor the majority of buildings using the standard Wat 01 method, the BREEAM Wat 01 calculator defines the \nbuilding type and range of different water-consuming activity areas within that building; for example, a retail \ndevelopment with sales area and goods storage or an office that includes a canteen and gym. However, where \ncarrying out a single assessment of a building or development which consists of a diverse mix of activity areas or \nbuilding types, all of which can be assessed separately within the calculator, the following applies: \n260\nTechnical Manual \u2013 Version 6.0.0 \u2013 01/12/2021 \u2013 SD250\n"

On completion of each assessment, the assessor will need to determine the \npercentage improvement as follows: \nWhere:\nI = Overall improvement (%)Tn Act = the modelled net water consumption (L/person/day) for each building type \nTn Base = the modelled baseline water consumption for the corresponding building type Tn Occ = the total \ndefault occupancy rate for the corresponding building type.\nWhere greywater or rainwater systems are specified, the assessor should take care to avoid unintended double \ncounting of the yield from such systems and using it to offset demand for each activity area or building type.\nFixed water use\nThe BREEAM water efficiency calculation includes an allowance for fixed water use. This includes water consumption \nfor vessel filling (for building users' drinking water), cleaning in kitchens and food preparation in buildings with a \ncatering facility. Fixed uses are included to provide greater accuracy in the reporting of the building's overall \nestimated water consumption. As these uses are fixed for both actual and baseline building models, their totals do \nnot influence the achievement of BREEAM credits.\nOther permissible component demand for non-potable water\nThe focus of this BREEAM issue is the performance of the building's permanent domestic-scale water-consuming \ncomponents. Where a greywater or rainwater system is specified, the yield from the system should be prioritised for \nsuch uses, i.e. WC or urinal flushing. However, where the building demonstrates that it has other consistent (i.e. \ndaily) and equivalent levels of non-potable water demand, and such demands are intrinsic to the building's \noperation, then it is permissible for the demand from these non-domestic uses to be counted, i.e. the demand for \nrainwater or greywater yield from such systems or components can be used as well as, or instead of, non-potable \nwater demand from the building's WC or urinal components. Examples of consistent and intrinsic demands could \ninclude laundry use in hotels or residential institutions, or horticultural uses in garden centres, botanical gardens \nand golf courses. Demand for general landscaping and ornamental planting irrigation are not considered as \nequivalent or intrinsic by BREEAM.\nOther permissible sources of non-potable water\nThe methodology allows for the collection and recycling of non-potable water from the relevant components listed \nin the criteria, i.e. taps, showers, baths and dishwashers or washing machines. In addition, where non-potable water \nis collected from a non-domestic component or source that is intrinsic to the building, then the amount collected \ncan be accounted for in the methodology. This could include, for example, wastewater from active hygiene flushing, \ni.e. a regular hygiene flushing programme to minimise poor water quality in a potable cold or hot water system. In \norder for the method to account for this total, the design team will need to confirm to the assessor the yield from \nthe component or system (in litres) and the frequency of that yield (in days), i.e. if once a week, the frequency would \nbe seven days.\nTechnical Manual \u2013 Version 6.0.0 \u2013 01/12/2021 \u2013 SD250\n261\n"

The calculator assesses the contribution that each internal domestic-scale water-consuming \ncomponent (as listed in the criteria) has on whole building water consumption. The calculator and \naccompanying guidance on its application is available separately from this Scheme Document. Please note, \nthe calculator is a compliance tool and not a design tool for water demand and drainage systems. The tool \nuses default usage and occupancy rates to provide a benchmark of the typical consumption given the \nspecified fittings (in L/person/day and m\u00b3/person/year) and their impact on the building's overall water \nefficiency. Due to the impacts and differences of actual user behaviour and occupancy rates, the results of the \nmethod will not reflect directly the actual water use during building operation. The results from the \nmethodology should, therefore, not be used for the purpose of comparison with, or prediction of, actual \nwater consumption from a non-domestic building.\nDomestic-scale components\n\u00a0\nDomestic-scale components include water consumed (potable and non-potable) by internal building \ncomponents including kitchen taps, wash hand basin taps, baths, showers and dishwashers, WCs, urinals, \nwashing machines and waste disposal units.\nEffective flush volume\n\u00a0\nThe effective flush volume of a single flush WC is the volume of water used for one flush. The effective flush \nvolume of a dual flush WC is the ratio of full flush to reduced flush. This is taken to be one full flush for \nevery three reduced flushes for non-domestic buildings and one full flush for every two reduced flushes in \ndomestic (residential) buildings or areas. The effective flush volume can therefore be calculated as follows, \nusing a 6/4 litre dual flush volume WC as an example:\n262\nTechnical Manual \u2013 Version 6.0.0 \u2013 01/12/2021 \u2013 SD250\n"

The following steps \noutline the process to be followed to determine the number of credits achieved for responsible sourcing.\nFor examples and a further explanation of this method, along with a simplified methodology for building services \nconstruction products, see Guidance Note 24.\nStep 1: Collating information and entering it in the BREEAM International Mat 03 tool \nFor all routes, the BREEAM International Mat 03 tool is used according to the following steps.\n1. For each construction product in the building that is in the scope (see Table 46 on page\u00a0291 under 'Scope of \nassessment' section below):\nNote: For Route 1, only steps 1.1,1.3,1.5,1.6,1.7 and 1.9 must be followed. Step 1.4 is optional for routes 1 and 2.\nStep 1.1: Estimate if the quantity of the product is above the cut-off volume (see CN3.3 on the previous page). \nIf it is, enter the construction product in the tool and assign it a ' Location and use' category, then proceed to \nthe next step. If the quantity meets the cut-off then the product can be excluded.\nStep 1.2 (Route 2 only): Estimate the quantity (mass or volume) of the product (see CN3.5 on the previous \npage).\nStep 1.3: Obtain the BREEAM recognised responsible sourcing certifications scheme (RSCS) certification or \nenvironmental management system (EMS) certification, if any (see CN3.2 on the previous page). Compare the \ncertification with Guidance Note 18 and obtain the RSCS point score. Where the construction product has no \ncertification, is non-compliant with broken chain requirements (see CN3.4 on the previous page) or the \ncertification type is not listed in Guidance Note 18, the score is zero. Where the construction product is a \nreused product, obtain the score from Guidance Note 18 for these products.\nStep 1.4 (Optional, if not being followed go to step 1.5): Where a constituent construction product has a \nbetter certification score (see CN3.2 on the previous page) than the overall construction product and it \ncomplies with the broken chain requirements (see CN3.4 on the previous page), the following steps should \nbe followed:\nStep 1.4.1: Identify the materials categories that make up an estimated \u2265 80% of the \nconstituent construction product's volume.\nStep 1.4.2: Include each identified materials category in the tool (by creating new rows in the \ntool).\nStep 1.4.3: If \u2265 5% of the volume is unaccounted for in step 1.4.1, include the 'Other' material \ncategory.\nStep 1.4.4 (Route 2 only): For each material following route 2 and identified in step 1.4.1, \nenter the building-wide quantity into the tool. This may be based on a percentage of the \noverall construction product's quantity estimated in step 1.1.\nStep 1.4.5: For each material category (including 'Other'), enter the constituent's certification \nscore identified in step 1.4 into the tool.\nStep 1.5: Identify the materials categories that make up an estimated \u2265 80% of the product's volume \n(excluding quantities entered for step 1.4.1 , if applicable).\nTechnical Manual \u2013 Version 6.0.0 \u2013 01/12/2021 \u2013 SD250\n285\n"

The species covered by CITES are listed in three appendices, \naccording to the degree of protection they need. \n\u00a01. Appendix I includes species threatened with extinction. Trade in specimens of these species is permitted \nonly in exceptional circumstances.\n\u00a02. Appendix II includes species not necessarily threatened with extinction, but in which trade must be \ncontrolled in order to avoid utilisation incompatible with their survival.\n\u00a03.

It contains a mix of policies and actions to help the UK to adapt \nsuccessfully to future weather conditions, by dealing with the risks and making the most of the opportunities.\n\u00a02. The book \"Design for climate change\"71 describes buildings and issues as part of the Design for Future \nClimate, Adapting Buildings programme, the largest programme focusing on the climate change adaptation of \nbuildings in the UK. This programme from the Technology Strategy Board (TSB) aims to improve the climate \nresilience of building projects. The book has guidance on construction, including structural stability.\n\u00a03. The BRE report72, Potential implications of climate change in the built environment, discusses climate change \nadaptation strategies, including some for structural resilience.\n334\nTechnical Manual \u2013 Version 6.0.0 \u2013 01/12/2021 \u2013 SD250\n"

Hydrogenated Fluorocarbon Refrigerants (HFCs) are made up of hydrogen, fluorine, and carbon. Because \nthey do not use a chlorine atom (which is used in most refrigerants) they are known to be one of the least \ndamaging to the earth's ozone layer.\n\u00a02. Hydrogenated Chlorofluorocarbon Refrigerants (HCFCs) are made up of hydrogen, chlorine, fluorine, and \ncarbon. These refrigerants contain minimal amounts of chlorine; they are not as detrimental to the \nenvironment as some other refrigerants.\n\u00a03. Chlorofluorocarbon Refrigerants (CFCs) contain chlorine, fluorine and carbon. These refrigerants carry \nhigh amounts of chlorine so they are known to be the most hazardous to the ozone layer.\nThe use of CFCs and HCFCs as refrigerants has been addressed under the Montreal protocol. Phase out \nprogrammes have been agreed resulting in these substances no longer being used as refrigerants in all new \ninstallations and most existing situations. The industry's favoured replacements are currently HFCs which are \noften potent global warming contributors. Hydrocarbons and ammonia-based refrigerants have low or zero \nGWP and are therefore preferred long term options. These are now widely available and are valid alternatives \nto HFCs in all buildings, provided health and safety issues are fully addressed.

NOx reacts with heat and \nsunlight to produce ozone that can cause serious respiratory problems. It also reacts with water to produce \nacid rain which has a detrimental effect on ecosystems. For the purposes of BREEAM, NOx emission levels are \nrequired in units of mg/kWh, measured on a dry basis at 0% excess oxygen levels.\nConversion factors\nManufacturers should be asked to supply NOx emissions data in mg/kWh, measured on a dry basis. Where this is not \npossible the assessor may use the following conversion factors to convert figures in parts per million (ppm), mg/MJ, \nmg/m\u00b3 or wet NOx. It should be noted that these conversion factors assume worst case efficiencies and are likely to \ngive conservative answers. This could have the effect of lowering the number of credits achieved. Note that these \nconversion factors are not applicable where combined heat and power (CHP) systems are being used. Please see the \ncalculation procedures below for further details on assessing CHP systems for this issue.\n\u00a01. Figures in mg/m\u00b3 should be multiplied by 0.859 in order to convert emissions into mg/kWh80. A conversion \nmay also be necessary for data not calculated at 0% excess oxygen.\n\u00a02. Figures in ppm should be multiplied by 1.76 in order to convert emissions into mg/kWh. A conversion may also \nbe necessary for data not calculated at 0% excess oxygen.\n\u00a03. Figures in mg/MJ should be multiplied by 3.6 in order to convert emissions into mg/kWh (1 kWh = 3.6 MJ). A \nconversion may also be necessary for data not calculated at 0% excess oxygen.\n376\nTechnical Manual \u2013 Version 6.0.0 \u2013 01/12/2021 \u2013 SD250\n"

However, if wet NOx figures are supplied, these will need to be converted to dry. The following formula should \nbe used to determine the wet NOx conversion factor81:\nConversion factor c = 100/(100-y)\nWhere y is the % water vapour content measured in the gas. This figure should be obtained from the manufacturer. \nExcess oxygen correction\nIf a NOx emission rate is quoted by the manufacturer in mg/m\u00b3 or ppm, then it should be established at what \npercentage excess oxygen this emission was measured. The greater the amount of excess oxygen in the flue gases at \nthe time of measurement, the more 'diluted' the NOx emissions. It is therefore important to convert any emission \nrate back to 0% excess oxygen. For the purpose of BREEAM, the following conversion factors can be used for the \nmost frequently used rates supplied by manufacturers:\nTable 60: Excess oxygen conversion factors\n% excess O\u2082\nConversion (c)\n3%\nx 1.17\n6%\nx 1.40\n15%\nx 3.54\nConversion factor c = 20.9/(20.9 \u2013 x)\nWhere x = % excess O\u2082 (NOT excess air) and 20.9 is the percentage of O\u2082 in the air.\nOther information\nSome systems may find it difficult to achieve credits in this issue, including:\nDistrict heating\nDistrict heating systems that incinerate waste usually have NOx emission rates higher than the levels set to achieve \nany BREEAM credits.\nBiomass\nBiomass systems are recognised as reducing the impact of fossil fuel depletion by employing a renewable fuel source \n(provided it is sustainably sourced). However, biomass can produce a significant amount of NOx and so may not \nachieve this credit.

The \ndischarge point is defined as the point of discharge into the watercourse or sewers (including rivers, streams, \nditches, drains, cuts, culverts, dykes, sluices, public sewers and passages through which water flows, see  Relevant \ndefinitions  on the next page). Where this calculation results in a peak flow rate of less than 5L/s, the limiting \ndischarge rate may be increased up to a level of no more than 5L/s at the point of discharge from the site to reduce \nthe risk of blockage. \nFor example, if the flow rate for the 1-year and 100-year events were 4L/s and 7L/s respectively, then the limiting \ndischarges would be 5L/s and 7L/s. Similarly, if it was calculated to be 2L/s and 4L/s, then a maximum of 5L/s limiting \ndischarge rate could be applied to both discharge points.\nSites should not be subdivided to enable higher overall limiting discharge rates to be claimed.

This section provides guidance to assessors and project teams on the application of BREEAM \nto shell only and shell and core projects.\nA shell only or shell and core building project is defined as one where the developer's scope of works is the design \nand construction of the base building only, leaving a range of construction and fit-out works to be completed \nbefore the building is able to be occupied. This may include some or all of the following elements: the structure, \nbuilding envelope, core building systems, including building servicing strategy and installations (such as HVAC) or \nplant support for installation of such systems and where present, fit-out of common areas. \nIn these projects, where areas of the development are not fully fitted, performance of the building and compliance \nwith BREEAM is verified based on the developer's scope of works. This is measured using two standard project type \noptions that in turn define appropriate assessment criteria applicable to that project type. While some projects will \ndiffer to some extent from the scope of these standard options, for the purpose of BREEAM, issues not included \nwithin the chosen option will be excluded from the assessment, even where they are within the developer's scope of \nworks. This approach is necessary to ensure clarity, consistency and comparability within the property market. A fully \nfilterable list of criteria or issues based on each individual project's scope would not enable comparability between \nBREEAM ratings, either in terms of performance benchmarking, or promotional or publicity purposes.\nDefining the shell and core project type\nFor the purpose of defining the scope of assessment and BREEAM certification labelling, a non-residential new \nconstruction project that is not fully fitted out can be categorised in to one of the following types:\nShell only assessment and certification\nShell and core assessment and certification.\nShell only assessment\nThis assessment and certification option is available where the developer's scope of works covers new build works to \nthe fabric, substructure and superstructure of the building only, including:\nExternal walls, windows, doors (external), roof, core internal walls, structural floors\nHard and soft landscaping areas (where present and within the scope of works).\nShell and core assessment\nThis option is available where the developer's scope of works covers shell works, as described in option 1, plus core \nbuilding services. Core building services relates to the installation of central or communal transport systems, water \nsystems, fit-out of common areas, central mechanical and electrical systems, including HVAC, but without local \nfitting of systems within tenant areas. The systems will typically be centralised with capped-off distribution to each \ntenanted area (for future connection as part of a tenant's fit-out works).\nThe shell only and shell and core assessment options are available for all building types, apart from residential \nindividual dwellings and apartment blocks, refer to Appendix E \u2013 Applicability of BREEAM New Construction to \nsingle and multiple dwellings, partially and fully fitted on page\u00a0412 for a more detailed description of residential \nassessment options.\nTechnical Manual \u2013 Version 6.0.0 \u2013 01/12/2021 \u2013 SD250\n409\n"

This is because most of the BREEAM criteria \nare concerned with impacts, processes and management procedures that occur with any new build development, \nregardless of whether it is a shell and core or fully fitted project. However, several BREEAM issues and criteria are \ntailored for the assessment of fitted out buildings, such as acoustic performance. Therefore, additional guidance is \ngiven within the assessment issues in the form of a compliance note. These shell and core compliance notes confirm \nwhether the assessment issue applies to a shell only or shell and core project and, where it does apply, how to assess \nit for the options or project types defined above.\nShell and core building assessments and minimum BREEAM standards\nAll minimum BREEAM standards remain applicable to shell and core building assessments for the developer's scope \nof works. The only exception is minimum standards for BREEAM issues, credits or criteria which are not assessed in a \nshell only or shell and core project (confirmed by the shell and core compliance note in each relevant issue).\nBREEAM International New Construction Version 6 and the BREEAM \nInternational Non-Domestic Refurbishment 2015 scheme\nBRE Global have developed a standalone BREEAM scheme to cover the refurbishment and fit-out stages of the life \ncycle for non-domestic buildings. Under this scheme, only criteria that fall within the scope of the tenant's fit-out \nworks would be assessed.\nBy having a two part assessment for the shell and core projects, where the shell and core parts and the fit\u2013out parts \nare assessed separately, BREEAM provides a flexible yet robust way of assessing shell and core projects.\nThe diagram in Figure 6 below outlines the relationship between the International New Construction and the \nInternational Refurbishment and Fit-out schemes.\nFigure 6: International New Construction and the International Refurbishment and Fit-out schemes and the \nassessment options\n410\nTechnical Manual \u2013 Version 6.0.0 \u2013 01/12/2021 \u2013 SD250\n"

However, in practice, there is \nno fixed industry standard definition of refurbishment and fit-out works, with a large degree of variability from \nproject to project. Due to this variability and also the need to ensure a consistent definition is used for assessment \ncomparability purposes, the BREEAM International Refurbishment and Fit-out scheme has defined a number of \noptional assessment 'parts'. The scope for each of these assessment parts has largely been based on setting \nboundaries around the key physical parameters of the building. Under that scheme, clients are able to seek \nassessment certification against any combination of parts according to the scope of their refurbishment and fit-out \nworks, therefore providing a highly flexible scheme.\nThe scope of Part 1 of the BREEAM International Refurbishment and Fit-out scheme aligns with option 1, the shell \nonly option of the BREEAM International New Construction scheme. Parts 1 and 2 combined align with option 2, \nthe shell and core option of the BREEAM International New Construction scheme.

This must be decided upon at the beginning of \nthe assessment process, within the Scoring and Reporting tool.\nSingle or multiple dwellings\nDefinition of a single dwelling\nA single dwelling is a permanent residential building, detached from any other building.\nOtherwise referred to as a \u2018home\u2019 or \u2018family unit\u2019, the \u2018single dwelling\u2019 is intended to be occupied by one single \nhousehold or family. Single dwellings must have no common areas or shared services with their surrounding \ndwellings.\nSingle dwellings are typically built on plots of land, greater in scale than the ground floor area, offering a privately \nowned, outdoor space. However, this may not always be the case for dwellings constructed on densely packed plots \nof land such as those built within towns or cities. For single dwellings that join onto other dwellings, as long as the \nother dwellings are not being assessed, then the \u2018single dwelling\u2019 criteria applies.\nAllowances can be made for dwellings with additional extensions or suites intended for extended family members, \nwithout changing the description from \u2018single dwelling\u2019.\nDefinition of multiple dwellings\nMultiple dwellings are any number of permanent residential buildings greater than one. They must be located on \nthe same plot of land and can either be joined together within the same building envelope or separated.\nFor example, a single, building envelope could consist of an apartment block or a row of terraces. Alternatively, it \ncould be a group of \u2018single dwellings\u2019 built on the same plot of land.\nPartially and fully fitted dwellings\nThe intention of the partial and fully fitted criteria is to recognise the need for greater flexibility during the \u2018Fit-out\u2019 \nstage in response to the Turn-key property market. Turn-key properties, are new homes sold on the open market as \ncomplete and intended for immediate occupation by the new homeowner.\nDefinition of Partially Fitted dwellings\nThese are new Turn-key homes intended to be occupied by the new homeowner where due to local building \npractices and cultural aspects, even though the property is considered \u2018complete\u2019 at the point of sale, the new \nhomeowner is still required to fit-out their new property with specific fixtures and fittings.\n412\nTechnical Manual \u2013 Version 6.0.0 \u2013 01/12/2021 \u2013 SD250\n"
