Minimum two (2) equally sized independent cells each with a lockable cover. As a \nminimum each cell is to provide 65% of total storage requirement.\n2. In areas where water supply is unreliable and sporadic, 7-day bulk raw water \nstorage externally should be provided. In turn the raw water bulk storage tank will \nsupply treated water day tanks sized in accordance with the above.\n3. Inlets and outlets are to be located at opposite ends of the tanks.\n4. Incorporate temperature probe to monitor stored water temperature and report to \nthe BMS.\n5. Glass-reinforced plastic (GRP) insulated tank sections suitable for drinkable water \nsupply. Where concrete tanks are provided, these are to be provided with a smooth \nfloated finish and should be lined with butyl liner to prevent contamination and \nmaintain water quality.\n6. Provide a minimum of 520 litres storage per guestroom per day plus catering \ndemand.\na) For resort properties provide 720 litres storage per guest room per day.\nb) Provide additional storage capacity for catering \nand laundry facilities to meet demand.\n7.
