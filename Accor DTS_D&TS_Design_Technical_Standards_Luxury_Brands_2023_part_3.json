Therefore, with the guest experience in mind, there are four \nmain goals the design team must address from the onset of the project:\n1. Design guest rooms that are aesthetically pleasing while providing privacy, safety and a \ncalming environment, which encourages guests to feel relaxed and comfortable so that \nthey enjoy their stay and are more apt to return.\n2. Design multi-purpose meeting spaces with acoustical environment and speech \nintelligibility levels appropriate for meetings and receptions, both large and small, where \na variety of communication styles can be effectively used and the sense of intimacy \nbetween presenter and audience can be experienced.\n3. Design food and beverage spaces that create a comfortable and safe environment for \ndiners and employees, free of distractions from kitchen noise, outdoor noise and noise \nfrom nearby conversations.\n4. Design a soothing, peaceful and calm environment for a true spa experience, without \ndistracting noise from adjacent spaces, from one treatment room to another and from \nexternal noise sources (such as street traffic).\nIn order to achieve these goals, there are several noise/vibration control and acoustics-related \nissues that must be addressed, regardless of the size of the property being designed.\nThese include, but are not limited to:\n \n\u2014 Noise transmission between guest rooms\n \n\u2014 Poor speech intelligibility in meeting spaces\n \n\u2014 Mechanical noise from HVAC elements\n \n\u2014 Elevator vibration in guest room and meeting spaces\n \n\u2014 Plumbing noise\n \n\u2014 External noise from adjacent roads and/or airport, etc.\nWhile the perceived unwanted sound and vibration varies, these are typically a result of \nairborne or structure-borne transmission. Regardless of the source of noise/vibration and \nthe transmission method, three main approaches (listed in order of cost-effectiveness) are \ncommonly used to mitigate noise and vibration:\n1. Control at the noise source location, \n2. Modify the transmission path, \n3. Control at the listener. \nAcoustics | Technical Document\nGeneral Requirements  |  Acoustics Design Criteria  |  1.
