The RAC will combine the \nsignals from the PMS, in-room occupancy sensors and the entry door position to determine \nthe room status and to initially set lighting and air-conditioning scenes. \nRoom occupancy can also be determined by the triggering of any button or switch on a Guest \ncontrol lighting switch within a rented and unoccupied room. \nGenerally, there are understood to be 7 room states: \n1. Unrented and unoccupied/vacant \n2. Unrented and occupied (staff) \n3. Rented and unoccupied/vacant \n4. Rented and occupied (staff) \n5. Rented and occupied Guest \n6. VIP Mode (set via GRMS - Guest Services) \n7. Out of Service (set via GRMS – Engineering/Guest Services) \n \nThe state of each room will be visible on the GRMS. The state of the room will be controlled by \nthe BMS with reference to PMS signal and occupancy algorithm commands as determined by \nthe master RAC. The room state can also be overridden by GRM operators with sufficient \ncredentials. \nAll room occupancy time delays shall be adjustable for each room via the GRMS interface. All \nroom setpoints, for heating and cooling, differentials, default fan speed and AC mode settings \nwill be adjustable for each room mode from the GRMS head end without the need for \nspecialized software tools. \nIn addition to the above 7 modes there are 3 other room states to consider: \n1. Welcome day scene – initiated on first entry to the room by the Guest during daytime \nhours \n2. Welcome night scene – initiated on first entry to the room by the Guest during night- \ntime hours \n3. Restore scene – after a Guest has left a rented room, and the unoccupancy timer has \nexpired, the room will assume the rented and unoccupied state and lighting and AC \nsettings will be adjusted as required by the brand. When the Guest returns to the \nroom, all lighting scenes, HVAC settings, will return to state set by the Guest before \nthey left the room. This can include the state of IPTV etc. \nThe following is intended to indicate the seven room states indicated above.  \n \n3.12.1 An unrented and unoccupied/vacant room \n• Lights master off scene \n• Non-essential power services off. \n• The blinds either up or down depending upon the local climate requirements. \n",

Action such as water quality routines valve flushing should however still \ncontinue. \n \n3.12.2 An unrented room occupied by Hotel staff  \n• Staff entry determined via door lock interface. Staff scene set \n• The lights set to staff scene \n• Non-essential power services should be on.  \n• The blinds up. \n• The air conditioning system set to staff scene levels. \n• The underfloor heating/cooling under local control. \n \n3.12.3 A rented but unoccupied/vacant room \n• Lights off. If awaiting Guest first arrival (welcome day/night scene) or if subsequent room \nre-entry by Guest set the restore scene on Guest entry. \n• Non-essential power services off except for any required desk/wall outlets as per brand \nstandards. \n• The blinds either up or down depending upon the local climate. \n• The air conditioning system off but maintaining a room temperature between 18°C and 24°C \n(adjustable).

In this mode the room Lighting, \nenvironment conditions and power sources shall remain in the occupied Guest mode until \ndeselected after Guest check out. \n \n3.12.7 Out of Service  \nThe GRMS shall be provided with an Out of Service function for the room. In this mode the \nroom lighting, environment conditions and power sources shall remain in off mode until the \nstate of the room is changed on the GRMS. \n \n3.13 OCCUPANCY ROOM SENSING \nThe GRMS shall be configured to determine the room occupancy state.  In the first instance, a \nhigh-level interface shall be provided to the PMS to determine whether the room is booked or \nunbooked.   \nIn the unbooked status, the room shall be set as described previously. However, facility shall \nbe provided to allow staff to override local room settings when entering the room. \n \nThe GRMS specialist shall propose a room occupancy detection system which shall include:  \n• Interfacing to the door lock and/or door movement sensing and  \n• The provision of motion and infrared body heat sensing detection.   \n \nThese devices shall be hardwired to the room automation controller in which appropriate \nsoftware shall be used to determine the room occupied status in conjunction with the room \nbooking status. \nThe room occupancy sensors are to be placed strategically around the Guest Room/Suites \nincluding all bathrooms. The occupancy sensors will be mapped across the room to ensure \nexcellent movement coverage. Where necessary the sensors shall include lux level monitoring \nthat shall be displayed on the GRMS central server display and wherever possible be an \nintegrated solution with room temperature sensing devices. \nBathroom occupancy sensors shall be suitably selected for the Ingress Protection (IP) rating \nand for capability to detect movement through shower screens. Appropriate delay shall be set \nto ensure that movement in bathrooms can be detected appropriately (e.g., for 30 minutes). \nThe occupancy system shall be easily configurable to allow changes of all room mode setback \nand control time delays, all room mode HVAC setpoints and dead bands to allow simple \nsensitivity and climate adjustment based on local Hotel requirements or changing/seasonal \nconditions.  \n",

These changes may be made due to seasonal changes (setpoints) or other \nfactors. The GRMS shall be designed to assist staff and provide operational efficiency gains. \nUnder no circumstances shall in-room key card occupancy readers or in-room key card \nswitches be provided to set the room occupied mode. \nIt is a requirement that RFID (with integrated BLE chip) access control shall be integrated into \nthe door leaf, door lock or outside corridor panel and combined with the DND/Doorbell touch \npanel to control the locking system and GRMS. \nThe GRMS specialist may propose the use of wireless room occupancy sensing however, these \nshall be provided with low battery status alarms that shall be visible in the alarm manager on \nthe GRMS head end. Wireless occupancy sensors should include temperature and humidity \nsensing (for use within the room algorithms) along with Passive Infra-Red (PIRs) movement \nsensing. \nAll occupancy sensors visible within the room shall have any Light Emitting Diode (LED) status \nindicators disabled. \nAppropriate measures will be taken by the occupancy logic to allow for determining “door just \nclosed”, exit delays for last minute switch settings, ignore delays for such issues as curtain \nclosure after exit. All delay periods shall be adjustable from the GRMS head end. \n \n3.14 WINDOW BLIND CONTROL \nWhere blinds are provided, these shall be complete with local actuators provided by the \nspecialist supplier. The MEP specialist shall provide the necessary power from a local fused \nspur located behind the curtain pelmet at an agreed location. \nThe blind control shall be initiated through the GRMS keypads or control stations that shall \ncommunicate commands to the RAC.  The controller in turn, shall switch an appropriate voltage \nfor an agreed time period to open/close the blind. The actuators shall be complete with a clutch \nto prevent over driving. \nThe blinds will operate to the requirement of the occupier and close when the room is in the \nsleep or unoccupied mode as appropriate. \n \n3.15 ROOM CONTROL STATIONS \nThe GRMS specialist shall provide wall mounted control stations as keypads, ganged switches \nor buttons, with ID and brand approved displays (where applicable) at appropriate locations \nwithin the room through which the Guest control and manage the Guest Room service. \nAll keypads and switches will be approved by ID and Brand and pre-tested in mock-up rooms \nbefore final approval for deployment.
