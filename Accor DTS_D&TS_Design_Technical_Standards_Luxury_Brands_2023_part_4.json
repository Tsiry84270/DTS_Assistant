Architecture\nSpace Planning\nIn order to complement the \u201cdesign to enable\u201d concept, effective space planning is key to \neliminate the majority of noise concerns at a much lower costs (and with much better results) \nwhen compared to remedial work for issues unaddressed during design.\nBy addressing architectural acoustics and noise and vibration control early in the design \nprocess, hotel guest spaces can be comfortable and productive places to rest and work. \nTherefore, the design team should avoid locating sensitive areas such as guest rooms \nand meeting spaces adjacent to potentially noisy areas such as mechanical rooms. When \nthat is not feasible, the project acoustical consultant should be involved in the process to \nrecommend possible noise/vibration control strategies and related costs and benefits.\nCurtain Wall\nThe project acoustical consultant shall conduct a study to determine the expected noise \nlevels at the project site and offer noise mitigating strategies that will  \nkeep noise levels within the limits defined herein while keeping the project  \ncosts within budget.\nBuilding orientation in relation to the noise source(s), noise barriers, etc., should be \nconsidered before relying entirely on the curtain wall to block all unwanted sounds.\nOnce the degree of isolation is established, curtain walls shall be designed based on OITC \n(Outdoor-Indoor Transmission Class) performance instead of STC (Sound Transmission \nClass). OITC is a better acoustical indicator for this purpose since it is determined based on \na spectrum shape that is an average of three typical spectra from transportation sources \n(aircraft take off, freeway, and railroad pass by), while STC is only accurate for speech sounds \nand not recommended for amplified music, mechanical equipment noise, transportation noise \nor any sound with substantial low- frequency energy below 125 Hz.\nInterior Walls\nIn order to provide the required sound transmission loss between adjacent noise sensitive \nspaces and/or between quiet and noisy areas, the following guidelines shall be observed:\n \n\u2014 Run all gypsum board layers vertically, with no joints except at the studs.\n \n\u2014 Stagger joints of gypsum board layers a minimum of 305mm (12 inches) apart where \nmultiple layers occur; tape outer joints only.\n \n\u2014 Caulk all partition types as per details provided in this section.\nAcoustics | Technical Document\nGeneral Requirements  |  Acoustics Design Criteria  |  1.

Fill the space around the pipe with a resilient  \nmaterial and caulk so that there is a complete seal between the pipe and the wall \nconstruction.\n \n\u2014 Provide constant field supervision during installation to ensure that integrity of the \nacoustically rated assembly is maintained and expected performance is achieved. \nOperable Partitions\nOperable partitions shall be manually operated because\n \n\u2014 Higher STC rated door assemblies are not motorised \n \n\u2014 Motorised assemblies do jam and when that happens it takes at least a few days to repair\n \n\u2014 Servicing motorised chain-operated partitions typically results in damaging the acoustical \nisolation between rooms which is left unrepaired\nBallroom operable partitions shall be top supported with individually suspended rolling panels \n(each equipped with two trolleys); floor tracks are not allowed.\nPartition tracks should be steel, not aluminium - steel tracks can be used to accommodate \ntemporary track hangers for AV equipment.\nThe track detailing must include a true acoustic isolation wall above the track to the slab \nabove with no unsealed penetrations.\nThe partition panels shall be stored in a concealed enclosure. The partition storage pocket \ndoors must not be relied upon to provide acoustical separation. Instead,  \nseal the partition to the rear of pocket at continuous solid blocking to avoid  \nflanking transmission.\nThe far end seal must be an extrusion; the door should not simply place a bulb seal against a \nwall. Block far-end seals/extrusions to avoid bowing.\nTop and bottom seals must be mechanically operated; drag seals must be avoided.\nPass doors in operable wall partitions are to be avoided since they compromise acoustic \nisolation effectiveness.\nNeither NIC nor STC based criteria include sound transmission below 125Hz.

HVAC Systems\nDesign Considerations\nNoise and vibration associated with heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system \nhave significant impact on the guest experience. Noise generated by cooling towers, chillers, \npumps, fans, piping, ductwork, and terminal air devices among others, can cause building \nelements to vibrate and produce unwanted sound. This can be very disruptive when guests \nare trying to rest, have productive meetings, and collaborate with remote individuals through \nvideo conferencing.\nWhile acoustical considerations must be made during all phases of the construction process, \ncontrol of the mechanical system noise is most effective if evaluated and addressed during \nthe early design phases. Noise and vibration control strategies implemented as retrofits after \nconstruction are expensive, disruptive and seldom meet expectations.\nThe quality of mechanical equipment and general construction is (typically) never better than \nwhen the building is brand new. As time passes and seals\nand bearings wear, the level of background noise will increase. Thus, compromising design \nstandards during value engineering, cost cutting, or material or method substitution \nprocesses will have a long term impact on the quality of the guest experience and the \nproperty reputation.\nFrom an acoustical standpoint, a typical design sequence should start with the selection of \nquietest equipment that complies with budget and operational requirements, located away \nfrom noise sensitive areas. This needs to be complemented with proper ductwork layout, \nadequate air velocities at terminal devices, and mechanical isolation from the building \nstructure.\nThe acoustical consultant for the project shall perform a numerical analysis (based on \nmanufacturer-provided data for the specified equipment) to confirm that the proposed HVAC \ndesign meets the applicable criteria.\nAcoustics | Technical Document\nGeneral Requirements  |  Acoustics Design Criteria  |  1.

Plumbing Systems\nDesign Considerations\nPlumbing noise can be as disrupting as HVAC noise when radiating into function spaces. \nTurbulent flow piping noise can be caused by water or other liquids passing through elbows, \nvalves or other transition pieces causing the pipe to vibrate. This vibration then radiates as \nairborne noise into the adjacent areas.\nLightweight PVC plastic pipe is now commonly used to replace cast iron, copper or mild \nsteel tubing. Because of its lightweight (i.e. low damping, mid-high radiation efficiency) \nconstruction, PVC pipes are easily set into motion due to fluid flow, with the result being an \nincrease in concerns and complaints directed towards noise.\nPlumbing Noise Control\nThe following are guidelines are intended to reduce plumbing noise:\n \n\u2014  Water velocity should not exceed 2m/s (6ft/s), and pipe sizes should be adjusted for this \nmaximum velocity.\n \n\u2014  Waste and water supply lines should not be installed in any walls enclosing noise sensitive \nspaces.\n \n\u2014  Vertical drain pipes should not be installed within interior or on the exterior walls of noise \nsensitive spaces.\n \n\u2014  The number of pipe transitions (tees, elbows, Y connections, etc.) should be kept to a \nminimum.\n \n\u2014  Regulators should be installed as required to ensure that the water pressure is no \ngreater than 344,000Pa (50pounds per square inch) in the main water supply lines.\n \n\u2014  Water-hammer arresters should be placed close to quick-acting valves and should be \ninstalled at the end of plumbing lines over 10m (35ft) long.\n \n\u2014  Plumbing penetrations on opposite sides of any sound-rated partition assembly should be \nseparated by a minimum distance of 406mm (16in).\n \n\u2014 Select plumbing valves of the ball-type which exhibit minimum noise when in use.\n \n\u2014  Select faucets and taps with fully ported nozzles and equipped with aeration or anti-\nsplash devices.\n \n\u2014  Waste piping and water supply piping should be isolated from the building construction at \npoints of contact with resilient sleeves, vibration isolators, or a minimum of 6.4mm (\u00bc-\ninch) of resilient material such as soft neoprene, rubber, felt padding, etc.\nAcoustical lagging over piping may be necessary when additional attenuation is required over \nnoise sensitive areas.\nAcoustics | Technical Document\nGeneral Requirements  |  Acoustics Design Criteria  |  1.

Electrical Systems\nGenerator Room\nWhile emergency generators are essential to ensure that critical building activities and \nlife safety systems are not compromised during power outages, the associated noise and \nvibration can be transmitted to sensitive areas through building partitions (walls and floors), \nthe structural system and generator ventilation systems, potentially disrupting business \nmeetings and guest room areas.\nAt the early stages of the design process, consideration must be given to key factors that \nwill determine the noise/vibration control strategies. These include generator size, generator \ntype (gas, diesel and bi-fuel), generator room location and generator usage (emergency vs. \npeak shaving).\nGenerator noise and vibration control requirements are project specific and should be \ndeveloped by the project acoustical consultant and coordinated with members of the design \nteam.\nArchitectural, structural, and mechanical design considerations should include  \nthe following:\n \n\u2014  Improved airborne sound isolation between the generator room and adjacent noise-\nsensitive spaces. Proper space planning can reduce noise and vibration control \nrequirements through buffering.\n \n\u2014  Space provision to accommodate large mufflers and silencers.\n \n\u2014  Absorptive finishes in the generator room should be included when feasible.\n \n\u2014  Structural support for the generator, an inertia base with two to three times the mass \nof the generator, and potentially a floating floor (when a slab-on-grade condition is not \npossible).\n \n\u2014  Minimised floor deflections to allow efficient operation of spring isolators. Seismic \nrequirements must also be evaluated.\n \n\u2014  Spring vibration isolators and inertia bases with two to three times the mass of the \ngenerator is required in most applications.\n \n\u2014  Hospital-grade silencers (or better) for combustion exhaust.\n \n\u2014  Silencers with large cross-sectional areas to meet insertion loss requirements and \naccommodate low pressure drop tolerances typical of generator  \nradiator fans.\nVibration isolation hangers and flex connection for all ductwork and piping.\nResiliently suspended ceilings may be required for spaces below the generator room.\nAcoustics | Technical Document\nGeneral Requirements  |  Acoustics Design Criteria  |  1.

The relative \nloudness depends on the construction of the transformer, the manner of installation and the \nambient sound level at the site.\nWhen transformers are not properly mounted or supported, their vibration is transmitted \nto the support structure and finds its way in neighbouring spaces, manifesting itself as an \nannoying tonal noise.\nPlanning of transformer placement and proper installation can significantly reduce \ntransformer noise. Therefore, the following guidelines should be observed.\n \n\u2014  Install transformer(s) as far as possible from areas where the sound could  \nbe objectionable.\n \n\u2014  Avoid placing transformer(s) near multiple reflective surfaces such as in a corner, near a \nceiling or floor, or in a hallway.\n \n\u2014  Isolate the transformer core and coils from the ground or supporting structure using \nproper vibration isolators. Air cooled dry transformers require isolating  \nthe core and coil from its support structure. Oil filled transformers require isolating the \ncore and coil from its tank base and isolate its tank base from the support structure.\n \n\u2014  Use flexible conduit couplings between the transformer and the wiring system. This \nincludes incoming cables, bus bars, stand-off insulators, etc., since any  \nrigid connection from the vibrating transformer to a solid structure will  \ntransmit vibration.\n \n\u2014  Mount transformer(s) on an inertia base or on a surface with the largest  \npossible mass.\n \n\u2014  The transformer room dimensions should not correspond to half wavelength of the \ntransformer noise/vibration frequencies.\n \n\u2014  The transformer room walls, ceiling, floor, and access doors shall be designed according \nto airborne transmission guidelines provided herein. The project acoustical consultant \nshall provide additional guidelines (including the use of sound absorptive materials) based \non the specific equipment selected for the project.\nAcoustics | Technical Document\nGeneral Requirements  |  Acoustics Design Criteria  |  1.

During acceleration/\ndeceleration and start/stop periods, vertical vibration shall not exceed RMS acceleration \nlevels of 0.1m2/s (~0.33sqft/s) between 1-80 Hz inclusive in any one third octave band.\nThe above limits apply to lifts with speeds of 4m/s (~13.1ft/s). For lift speeds of  \n4-7m/s (~13.1-23ft/s), the above specified acceleration limits can each be increased  \nby a factor of 1.5.\nVibration measurements shall be made on the floor at the centre of the car, in three mutually \nperpendicular axes, corresponding to vertical vibration and lateral quaking.

Elevators from the car park accessing \nGuest Floors must stop on the Ground floors and the doors must open in an \nupwards and downwards travel. Card key operation is preferred to prevent \nunlawful access to guest floors by unauthorised persons.\nPublic Spaces\nWhen meeting rooms and/or bars/restaurants are located above or below the \nfront desk level, they must be served by: \n \n\u2014\nThe bedroom guest lifts \n \n\u2014\nSeparate lifts \nReception\nWhen the front desk is not located on the access/street level, lifts must be \nprovided to serve the reception level from the street entrance lobby. These \nlifts may also serve the car park. A minimum of 2 dedicated \u201cHotel reception\u201d \nlifts shall always be required. See notes for guest floors.\nCar Parks\nWhen the car park is located underground or on a level different from the \nentrance level, the car park must be served by one or more lifts separate from \nthe bedroom guest lifts, depending on traffic study. \nService Areas\nClean and Dirty elevators must be provided to meet International HACCP \nrequirements. These elevators will be provided for staff movements, linen, \nservice, room-service and luggage service.  Two or more service lifts are \nrequired depending on the traffic study, hotel brand requirements or local \nauthorities (Separate lifts are to be required for segregate \u201cclean\u201d and \u201cdirty\u201d \nuse).\nConference and \nBanqueting areas\nA specific vehicle lift may be required when the conference and banqueting areas \nare not located on street level, to allow access for exhibition setting-up works or \nto display vehicles or large equipment). To avoid the need to provide multiple lifts \nfor different services, a single service lift may usually serve multiple uses. These \ncombinations of use must be considered based on hotel size to ensure that they do \nnot result in a conflict of traffic which could disrupt or delay service. They must also \ncomply with local regulations regarding possible segregation of \u201cclean\u201d and \u201cdirty\u201d \nservices\nOther services\nOther service lifts may be required depending on the configuration of the \nbuilding or when required by the traffic study or by local authorities (In \nparticular, back of house areas - delivery area, kitchens and public areas - are \nsplit over several levels).\n \n\u2014\nRelay kitchen service\n \n\u2014\n2nd relay kitchen service\n \n\u2014\nKitchen supply\n \n\u2014\nKitchen waste disposal\nVertical Transportation | Technical Document\nGeneral Requirements  |  1.

This will have to be assessed by experts and maintenance \ncompanies, on a project-by-project basis. \n1.7 \nImproving sustainability\nThe following topics can be considered for improving sustainability:\na) LED lighting in the lift cabin\nb) Stand-by modus lighting, so that lights in the car will turn off when the lift is not in use\nc) Stand-by modus control and frequency inverter will turn off when the lift is not in use\nd) Regenerative design so that energy can be regenerated back to the grid\ne) Materials Passports to promote recycling of materials\nf) Gearless motors so that the drive will consume less energy\n1.8 \nImproving the appearance\na) Narrowcasting so that information can be communicated to visitors to the hotel.\nb) Screen communication, whereby not only information is shared, but users of the lift can \nalso communicate back\nc) Video calling when people are trapped in the elevator, what will make people less anxious.\n1.9 \nImproving safety\na) Evacuation batteries (UPS) are required. This means that in the event of a malfunction, \nthe lift will continue to the main access floor where the doors can be opened. Elevator \nlanding devices are required in case of loss of power.\n1.10 Addition of functionalities\na) Contactless lift control, so that elevator operation can be done earlier, reducing waiting \ntimes.\nb) Card key access-control so that access to the hotel rooms can be better regulated.\nc) Reception lift control that will improve the service level towards hotel guests. \nd) Destination indicators so that awaiting guests of the elevator are better informed, which \ngives the impression the waiting times are shorter.\ne) Improvement of passenger\u2019s arrival information:\n \n\u2014 Signalisation on the floors e.g., floor indicators, voice announcers, arrival gongs;\n \n\u2014 Realtime travel information on screens.\nVertical Transportation | Technical Document\nGeneral Requirements  |  1.

Traffic Assessment\n2.1 \nGeneral \nThe Traffic Simulation and Analysis are the basis for determining the settings of the lift \ninstallations. The expected use of stairs must be taken into account. This not only depends \non the presence of the stairs, but also on the accessibility of the stairs. \na) It is essential to appoint a lift engineering expert/consultant to collaborate with the project \ndesign team from the very beginning of the project to carry-out or check the pre-sizing and \nfinal sizing and specifications of all vertical transportation systems including a traffic study. \nb) The project manager must check that the traffic study results, and proposed lift sizing and \nspecifications are compliant with the performance criteria from the Accor selected hotel \nbrand, as specified in the Accor Brand Standards. (And its associated control checklist).\nc) Traffic assessments should comply to national regulations and worldwide excepted \nguidelines (e.g., CIBSE Guide D). The lift system must also be assessed by means of a \nsimulation model.\nd) Traffic assessments should be done for every scenario, e.g.  guest lifts, rooftop bar, parking \nand shuttle lifts. \n2.2 \nAssessment principles\nTable 21: Assessment principles\nBASIC PRINCIPLES\nType of analysis\nSimulation\nNumber of simulations\n20 runs for each configuration\nTime slice between simulations\n0,1s\nDispatcher type\nAs applied\nSimulation mode\nHotel traffic (CIBSE Guide D) and other relevant (like restaurant/\nbreakfast and separate simulation for rooftop bar)\nSimulation time\n\u2265 60 mins\nVertical Transportation | Technical Document\nGeneral Requirements  |  1.
